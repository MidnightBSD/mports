To enable the tor server, set tor_enable="YES" in your /etc/rc.conf
and edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/tor/torrc as desired. (However, note that the
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/tor rc.subr script can override some torrc
options: see that script for details.) To use the torify script, install
the net/torsocks port. After installing tor for the first time, or after
a major update of tor, you should:

rm -r /var/db/tor /var/run/tor
mkdir -p /var/db/tor/data /var/run/tor
touch /var/log/tor
chown -R _tor:_tor /var/db/tor /var/log/tor /var/run/tor
chmod -R 700 /var/db/tor

before starting the tor server.
