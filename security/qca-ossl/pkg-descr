Taking a hint from the similarly-named Java Cryptography Architecture,
QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto
API, using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from
the implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage
of this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or
explicitly depending on any particular cryptographic library. This
allows one to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations
without even needing to recompile the application. QCA should work
everywhere Qt does, including Windows/Unix/MacOSX.

SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD160,
Blowfish, DES, 3DES, AES128, AES192, AES256, CAST5, HMAC(SHA1, MD5,
RIPEMD160), PBKDF1(MD2, SHA1), PBKDF2(SHA1)
