You may wish to run sa-update now to obtain the latest rules.

NOTE:  BSD users: If you are updating from a version prior to 3.20.
sa-update now places state files in /var/db/spamassassin and not 
/var/lib/spamassassin. 

If you run sa-compile, you will notice that files are in 
/var/db/spamassassin/compiled/<perlversion>/<version> instead of
/var/db/spamassassin/compiled/<version>.
No attempts have been made to move old versions over. You must recompile.

If you are running with spamd, you must add the following to rc.conf:
spamd_enable="YES"

Security Note:  If you did NOT deselected AS_ROOT, spamd will be running
as root. To change this, also add this to rc.conf:
spamd_flags="-u spamd -H /var/spool/spamd"
