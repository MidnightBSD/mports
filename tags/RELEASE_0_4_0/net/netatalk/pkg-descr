Netatalk is an OpenSource software package, that can be used to turn an
inexpensive *NIX machine into an extremely high-performance and reliable
file server for Macintosh computers.

Using Netatalk's AFP 3.2 compliant file-server leads to significantly higher
transmission speeds compared with Macs accessing a server via SaMBa/NFS
while providing clients with the best possible user experience (full support
for Macintosh metadata, flawlessly supporting mixed environments of classic
MacOS and MacOS X clients)

Due to Netatalk speaking AppleTalk, the print-server task can provide
printing clients with full AppleTalk support as well as the server itself
with printing capabilities for AppleTalk-only printers.  Starting with
version 2.0, Netatalk seamlessly interacts with CUPS on the server.

After all, Netatalk can be used to act as an AppleTalk router, providing
both segmentation and zone names in Macintosh networks.
