You can now switch between the different rendering engines in
Konqueror (a website must be open) through the menu:
View -> View Mode -> {KHTML, WebKit}.
If WebKit does not show up in Konqueror, run `kbuildsycoca4` and
restart Konqueror.

If you want to set KWebKitPart as default for any website, run
`keditfiletype text/html` and move "WebKit (kwebkitpart)" in the
"Embedding" tab to the top.
