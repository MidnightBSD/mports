Obmenu is a menu editor designed for Openbox.  It's easy to use, allowing
you to get the most out of the powerful Openbox menu system, while hiding
the xml layout from the user.

It can install dynamic menus (pipe menus), such as Gnome menus or a
quick-navigator.  You can also use the obxml module to easily write pipe
menus of your own in Python.
