   Note: for people upgrading from earlier versions to sphinx-0.9.9
   ================================================================

   Please be aware that sphinx now uses these IANA[1] sanctioned port
   numbers by default:

    sphinxql        9306/tcp    Sphinx search server (MySQL listener)
    #                           Andrew Aksyonoff <shodan&sphinxsearch.com> 20 October 2009

    sphinxapi       9312/tcp    Sphinx search server
    #                           Andrew Aksyonoff <shodan&sphinxsearch.com> 20 October 2009

   This is a change from the port numbers used by default in earlier
   versions.
