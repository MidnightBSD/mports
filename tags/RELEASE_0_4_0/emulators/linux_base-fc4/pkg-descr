This port contains packages from a near-minimal installation of Fedora Core
Linux 4.  These packages, in conjunction with the linux kernel module,
form the basis of the Linux compatibility environment.

This port is only available for the i386/amd64 architecture (i386/32 bit mode). 
If you use an Alpha computer, please install the linux_base port instead
of this one.

If you want to run X11 applications, install the x11/linux-XFree86-libs port.
