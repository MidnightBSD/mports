INADYN is a dynamic DNS client, it maintains the IP address of a host name by 
periodically checking whether the IP address stored by the DNS server is the 
real current address of the machine that is running INADYN.

Supported dynamic DNS services are: dyndns.org (in all three flavors: dynamic, 
static, custom), freedns.afraid.org, zoneedit.com, no-ip.com
