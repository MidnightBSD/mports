The core of the Struts framework is a flexible control layer based
on standard technologies like Java Servlets, JavaBeans,
ResourceBundles, and Extensible Markup Language (XML), as well as
various Jakarta Commons packages. Struts encourages application
architectures based on the Model 2 approach, a variation of the
classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.

Struts provides its own Controller component and integrates with
other technologies to provide the Model and the View. For the
Model, Struts can interact with any standard data access
technology, including Enterprise Java Beans, JDBC, and Object
Relational Bridge. For the View, Struts works well with JavaServer
Pages, including JSTL and JSF, as well as Velocity Templates, XSLT,
and other presentation systems.

The Struts framework provides the invisible underpinnings every
professional web application needs to survive. Struts helps you
create an extensible development environment for your application,
based on published standards and proven design patterns.

Struts is part of the Apache Jakarta Project, sponsored by the
Apache Software Foundation. The official Struts home page is at
