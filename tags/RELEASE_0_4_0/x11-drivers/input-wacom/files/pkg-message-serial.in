To setup the wacom driver for X run the following commands as the root user:
# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom onesetup

Now open your xorg.conf file and check weather the correct serial device
was chosen. If you are using a USB to serial converter you might have
to change it to cuaUX.

You can clean up the Xorg configuration by running the following command
before deinstalling:
# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom onecleanup

Now (re)plug in your tablet and restart X.
