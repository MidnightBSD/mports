Replacement for the GNU Objective-C runtime supporting the features
of Objective-C 2 for use with GNUstep and other Objective-C programs.
This runtime is based on the Etoile Objective-C Runtime, an earlier
research prototype, and includes support for non-fragile instance
variables, type-dependent dispatch, and object planes. It is fully
compatible with the FSF's GCC Objective-C ABI and also implements
a new ABI that is supported by Clang and is required for some of
the newer features.
