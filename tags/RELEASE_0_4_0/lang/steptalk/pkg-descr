StepTalk is the official GNUstep scripting framework. StepTalk is more
than a scripting framework with an illusion of single objective
environment between objects of scriptable servers or applications.
StepTalk, when combined with the dynamism that the Objective-C
language provides, goes way beyond mere scripting. It is language
independent - it uses languages as separate bundles.
