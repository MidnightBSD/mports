This script, meant to be run monthly, submits statistics anonymously
to a central checkin server (http://bsdstats.org), in an attempt to
generate reasonably accurate demographics of both *BSD usage, as well
as devices in use.

Steps have been taken to make eliminate security concerns brought up
in earlier releases of this, including, but not limited to, not storing
anything in the database that has been deemed as 'sensitive' (ie. IP of
the reporting server, and hostname).
