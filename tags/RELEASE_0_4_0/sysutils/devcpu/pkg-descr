This kernel module provides access to i386/amd64 CPUs MSR (Model Specific
Register) registers and cpuid info through /dev/cpu%d devices, where %d
corresponds to cpu number.

It can be used with x86info to retrive information available from MSR registers.

Additionally, this module can be used to update/replace microcode of cpus.
