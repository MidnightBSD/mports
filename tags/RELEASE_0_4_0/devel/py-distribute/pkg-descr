Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method for working
with Python module distributions.

The project has two goals:
- Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools and make all
  distributions that depend on Setuptools work as before, but with less bugs and
  behavioral issues.
- Re-factoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions. This work is
  being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.
