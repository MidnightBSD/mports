What is pmk:

The meaning of pmk is "Pre Make Kit", a dependency configuring tool.
It aims to be considered as an alternative to GNU autoconf.

Goals:
 
*) Avoid the use of scripts in packages that can hide trojans.
*) Try to keep the needed dependencies near from zero (actually we're
   at zero).
*) Make it easy to use for users and developers.
*) Provide the package in a free and usable license for everybody (BSD).
*) Limit the changes in sources for a transition from autoconf.
