tradcpp is a traditional (K&R-style) preprocessor.

It has the particular property that it doesn't (for the most part)
trash whitespace, so it can be used on makefiles.

This is only release 0.1; it is missing some features and doubtless
has quite a few bugs, but it's capable of building at least some
packages when used with imake.
