This package doesn't contain any manuals nor examples, but
it wouldn't be a problem, as the interface of this module
is exactly the same as DBM and SDBM, except GDBM has a
"reorganize" method.  See the DBM module's document included
in the ruby-man package, and gdbm(3) manpage included in the
gdbm package.
