Kooka is an intuitive, easy to use open source GNU/Linux scan program
which is released under the GNU General Public License with exceptions.

Kooka is the scan application of choice for the KDE project and
thus it is official part of the KDE Graphics Package.

Kooka helps you to handle the most important scan parameters, find
the correct image file format to save and manage your scanned images.
It offers support for different OCR modules. Libkscan, a autonomous
part of Kooka, provides a scan service for easy and consistent use
to all KDE applications.
