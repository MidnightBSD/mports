Tmsnc is a textbased (console) MSN client written in C. 
Tmsnc should work on most Unix (Linux, BSD, MacOS) compatible operating systems.

The goal of this project is to create a client like MSN Messenger
(with sound, webcam and file transfer support), 
but without any graphical features.

Instead tmsnc has an interface written in NCurses, 
a library for textbased terminal interaction.
