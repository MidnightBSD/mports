Yet Another Bandwidth Meter displays current bandwidth utilization using the
PNG image format. It somewhat resembles the Linux bwbar (although there is no
connection to it).

Features include measurement both on interface and assigned IP-address basis,
possible to run non-root and non-setuid, quite customizable (colours, geometry,
device max speed, etc). It also includes text output to the image.
