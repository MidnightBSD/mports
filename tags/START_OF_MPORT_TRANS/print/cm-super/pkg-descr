The CM-Super package contains Type 1 fonts converted from METAFONT fonts and
covers entire EC/TC, EC Concrete, EC Bright and LH fonts (Computer Modern
font families). All European and Cyrillic writings are covered.
Each Type 1 font program contains ALL glyphs from the following
standard LaTeX font encodings: T1, TS1, T2A, T2B, T2C, X2, and also
Adobe StandardEncoding (585 glyphs per non-SC font and 468 glyphs
per SC font), and could be reencoded to any of these encodings
using standard dvips or pdftex facilities (the corresponding support
files are also included).
