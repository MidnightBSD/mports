StarOffice 7.0 is a suite of office productivity applications containing
a word processor, spreadsheet, graphics and presentation, image
manipulation, and charting.  StarOffice offers the ability to read and
write Microsoft Office files.

The integrated StarOffice5.2 desktop, email-client and calendar have been
removed to concentrate work on the core applications.
