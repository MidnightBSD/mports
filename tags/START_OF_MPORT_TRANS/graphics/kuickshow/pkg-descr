KuickShow is an image browser/viewer with a nice filebrowser to
select images to be shown, slideshow support and the ability to
display the following image formats: jpg, gif, tiff, png, bmp, psd,
xpm, xbm, pbm and eim. Images can be displayed either in their own
window, as large as the image, or fullscreen (which shrinks images
too large to display).  KuickShow also has a slideshow mode.
