A windowmanager based on aewm++.

Here is a compact list of changes between the originial aewm++-1.1.16 code and 
pekwm, pekwms code is also alot restructured and reformatted.

    * Possibility to group windows in a single frame
    * Configurable keygrabber
    * Configurable rootmenu
    * Configration file
    * Xinerama support
    * "Smart" window placement
    * Basic pixmap theming, with configurable buttons
    * Some nifty extra bugs! ;)
