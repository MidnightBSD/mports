Netclasses is an easy to use interface to socket programming in Objective-C
with GNUstep. The core netclasses supports virtually any protocol, but the
distribution comes with everything needed for TCP/IP (opening ports,
background connections, etc.). Netclasses seamlessly integrates into
NSRunLoop, which means there should be no need for redesigning applications
to use it.
