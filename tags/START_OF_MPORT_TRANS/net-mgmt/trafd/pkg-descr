trafd is a superset of trafshow, and extends it by adding a daemon
which collects data about network connections (src, dst, protocol
and length). The resulting data can be dumped to a file for later
processing.

Read /usr/local/share/doc/trafd/README after installation for more
information.

To use trafd, your kernel must be rebuilt with the following line
added to your kernel config file (/sys/i386/conf/<YourMachine>):

pseudo-device   bpfilter        4       # Berkeley packet filter

The number after bpfilter is the number of interfaces that can be
examined simultaneously. See section 6.1 of the Handbook for details.

On FreeBSD 4.0 or later versions, use the following line instead:

pseudo-device  bpf     4  # Berkeley packet filter
