A Linux RSS monitor for RSS and Atom feeds that lets you
monitor many feeds at once and supports feed access through a web 
(HTTP) proxy. Configure a feed to your liking, click "add/update" to
record your data and "instantiate" to create a window for the feed.
Right-click on the feed browser to display the feed menu, or use the
main menu. A ticker window for a feed displays headlines for all
articles in the feed. Right-click on the window or on the main menu to
display the "article" menu, where you may display the text of the
article, view it in a browser, follow the article link if there was
one or display a browser for all articles in the feed. Right-click on
the browser or the article content view to display the article menu
and apply it to the currently selected article. Right-click on the
article text view to display the "article" menu. Article text views
will be collected when the feed updates. The headline view will
flash/beep when the data in the feed change. You may have to
experiment to find a font that displays your language correctly. I
have found that Helvetica works well with Google's German, French and
Spanish feeds.
