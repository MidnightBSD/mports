mplayerplug-in is a browser plugin that uses mplayer to play digital
media from websites.

This plug-in gives Mozilla the ability to play media from a website
the net without reading the source html and getting the url manually.
Media is played embedded in the page or in a separate window depending
on how the author of the webpage intended the media to be seen.
