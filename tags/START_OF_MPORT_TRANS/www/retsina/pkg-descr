Retsina is a redirector and access controller for Squid. It uses a
database backend to manage the URL lists and their various domains.

Some reasons to consider using retsina include:

    * Under active development
    * Powerful configuration parser written in Lex and YACC
    * No URLs to read in at startup
    * Inherited constraints for timeslots within other timeslots
    * Immediatly effective database changes - no restart necessary
