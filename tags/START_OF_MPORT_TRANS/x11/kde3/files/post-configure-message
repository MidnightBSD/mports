Configuration and first installation step finished. Run 'make install' to
install the rest of the modules you selected. Run 'make clean && make' to
re-enter the configuration. Please note that you CANNOT REMOVE modules
through this menu system, use pkg_delete instead.

If you do not want the menu to run, put BATCH=YES into /etc/make.conf
(this will install all KDE modules).

If you do not want the menu to run AND you do not want specific
modules to be installed, put lines reading 'WITHOUT_<Name-of-Module>=YES'
into /etc/make.conf (for example WITHOUT_KOFFICE=YES).
