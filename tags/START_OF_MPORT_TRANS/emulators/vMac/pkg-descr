What is vMac? vMac is a free software emulator that emulates the Apple
Macintosh Plus(tm). That means that vMac does not cost anything, and
does not use any hardware. A lot of the Macintosh Plus' functionality is
already implemented in this port, and that includes:

- 68000 CPU, 68010 CPU, 68020 CPU + 68881 FPU emulation
- 4 MB of RAM
- Keyboard support   
- Mouse support
- Floppy support
- HardDisk support (However, vMac will treat all harddisks or partitions
                       as floppies).
- Sound support (soon!)
- Can run MacOS (System Software) versions up to 7.5.5

Currently, work is being done on IceCube, a new CPU emulator which will
replace UAE's CPU emulator which we use currently, and other stuff :).
