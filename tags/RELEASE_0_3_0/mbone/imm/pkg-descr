IMM has been designed to efficiently replicate files/file directories
using a reliable dissemination protocol framework and provide archiving
and post processing features.  The default mode of operation is for imm
to receive and display compressed imagery files (e.g., jpg,gif) using
xv or xloadimage as a post processor.

This release includes an sdr plug-in, named sdr2.plugin.S53.image.imm,
which must be installed to participate in MBone alpha testing of imm sessions.
Usually in a directory called ~home/.sdr/plugins to be found by sdr.
See the sdr help pages for information on installing plugins.
