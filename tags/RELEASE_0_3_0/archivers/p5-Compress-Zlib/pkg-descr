       The Compress::Zlib module provides a Perl interface to the
       zlib compression library (see the AUTHORS entry elsewhere
       in this document for details about where to get zlib). Most
       of the functionality provided by zlib is available in
       Compress::Zlib.

       The module can be split into two general areas of
       functionality, namely in-memory compression/decompression
       and read/write access to gzip files. Each of these areas
       will be discussed separately below.

       WARNING: The interface defined in this document is alpha
       and is liable to change.
