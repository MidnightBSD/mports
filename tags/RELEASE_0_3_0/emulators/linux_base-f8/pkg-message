Installation of the Linux base system is finished. The Linux kernel
mode, which must be enabled for Linux binaries to run, is now
enabled. Linux mode can be enabled permanently with the linux_enable
variable of rc.conf(5).

To make use of NIS you have to adjust yp.conf and nsswitch.conf in
/compat/linux/etc/ accordingly. For example:

Set your yp-server and yp-domainname in yp.conf:
	domainname	my.yp.domainname
	ypserver	my.yp.server

Let your lists for hosts, passwd and group be resolved via nsswitch.conf:
	passwd:	files nis
	shadow:	files nis
	group:	files nis
	hosts:	files dns nis

WARNING: doing work which needs to chroot into the linux base may not work.
In such cases (e.g. cross-development) you are better suited with a linux_dist
port.

It is recommended to have compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 in /etc/sysctl.conf
and put OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f8 in /etc/make.conf
