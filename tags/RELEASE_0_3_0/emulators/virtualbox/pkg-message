VirtualBox was installed.

You need to load the vboxdrv kernel module and a mounted /proc filesystem.

% mount -t procfs proc /proc
% kldload vboxdrv

You also have to add all users to your vboxusers group in order to use vbox.

% pw groupmod vboxusers -m jerry

Running VirtualBox as non-root user may fail with a fatal error 
NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED. In this case delete /tmp/.vbox-*-ipc file.

Please report any problems to maintainer. Thanks!
