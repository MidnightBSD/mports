If you hear cracks and pops with some applications, adjust the
OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE environment variable, for instance:

	export OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE=8192
	fgfs

If the OPENAL_BUFFER_SIZE environment variable is not set, the default sound
card buffer size is used.

Increasing the audio buffer size increases the audio latency but decreases the
CPU usage; decreasing the audio buffer size decreases the audio latency but
increases the CPU usage (which can cause cracks and pops).
