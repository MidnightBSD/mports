libgpod is a shared library to access the contents of an iPod.  This
library is based on code used in the gtkpod project.  Starting with
V0.96.CVS gtkpod depends on this library.

This code was originally part of gtkpod itself.  When the parsing code
was made self-contained with gtkpod V0.93, decision was made to put
this code in a separate library so that other projects can benefit from
it without duplicating code.

libgpod supports playlists, smart playlists, playcounts, ratings, podcasts,
cover art, audio and video.  Photo support is implemented as well.
