What is giFT, you ask? giFT is a modular daemon capable of abstracting the
communication between the end user and specific filesharing protocols
(peer-to-peer or otherwise). The giFT project differs from many other similar
projects in that it is a distribution of a standalone platform-independent
daemon, a library for client/frontend development, and our own homegrown
network, OpenFT. 


The goal of this project is to ensure that user interface developers never waste
time with the low-level details of a protocol and that network programmers never
waste time with the user interface details. Along those same lines it allows end
users to control which protocols they use no matter which giFT interface they
have selected as their favorite. Any new filesharing network can be supported
without any change to the user interface.
