Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build,
reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Maven 2.0 is a rewrite of the popular Maven application to achieve a number of
goals, and to provide a stable basis to take it into the future.
