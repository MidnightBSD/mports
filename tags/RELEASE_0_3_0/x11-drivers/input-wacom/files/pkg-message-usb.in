To setup the wacom driver for X and start the kernel module upon boot
run the following commands as the root user:

# echo 'wacom_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom setup

You can unload the driver and clean up the Xorg configuration by
running the following lines before deinstalling:
# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom cleanup
# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom stop

To activate the driver without rebooting run:

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/wacom start

Now (re)plug in your tablet and restart X.
