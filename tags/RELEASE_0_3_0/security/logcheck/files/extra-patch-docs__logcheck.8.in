+.SH NAME
+logcheck \- program to scan system logs for interesting lines
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+
+\fBlogcheck\fR [ \fBOPTIONS\fR ]
+
+.SH "DESCRIPTION"
+.PP
+The \fBlogcheck\fR program helps spot problems and
+security violations in your logfiles automatically and will send the
+results to you periodically in an e-mail. By default logcheck runs as 
+an hourly cronjob just off the hour and after every reboot.
+.PP
+\fBlogcheck\fR supports three level of filtering:
+"paranoid" is for high-security machines running as few services
+as possible. Don't use it if you can't handle its verbose messages.
+"server" is the default and contains rules for many different daemons.
+"workstation" is for sheltered machines and filters most of the messages.
+The ignore rules work in additive manner. "paranoid" rules are also
+included at level "server" and "workstation".
+.PP
+The messages reported are sorted into three layers, system events,
+security events and attack alerts. The verbosity of system events is 
+controlled by which level you choose, paranoid, server or workstation. 
+However, security events and attack alerts are not affected by this.
+.SH "EXAMPLES"
+.PP
+\fBlogcheck\fR can be invoked directly thanks
+to su(8) or sudo(8), which change the user ID. The following example checks the logfiles
+without updating the offset and outputs everything to STDOUT.
+.PP
+sudo -u logcheck \fBlogcheck\fR -o -t
