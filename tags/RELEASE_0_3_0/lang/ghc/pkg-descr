Haskell is the standard lazy purely functional programming language.
The current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998,
with a revised version published in January 2003.

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from
the Haskell home page at http://haskell.org/.

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising
compiler for the functional programming language Haskell 98 generating
good code for a variety of platforms. GHC is a state-of-the-art
programming suite for Haskell and compiles Haskell to either native
code or C. It implements numerous experimental language extensions to
Haskell, including concurrency, a foreign language interface, several
type-system extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a
generational garbage collector, a space and time profiler, comprehensive
set of libraries and an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.

The profiling libraries for Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System
should be installed when GHC's profiling subsystem is needed.
