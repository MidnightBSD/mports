Note: This version of valgrind does not support some older processors, 
      e.g. AMD K6-III, some (?) Pentium II.

      If valgrind crashes immediately after it was started with the error
      message "Illegal hardware instruction", your processor is affected by
      this problem.

      As a workaround you can use the devel/valgrind-snapshot port, which is
      based on a more recent snapshot.

Note 2: A sample suppression file might have been installed to \
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/freebsd-default.supp. It makes Valgrind hide warnings
      caused by flawed code sequences - if any - in your system libraries,
      so that you can concentrate on the warnings issued for your own code.

      To use these suppressions, either pass
      --suppressions=%%PREFIX%%/etc/freebsd-default.supp
      to Valgrind on the commandline, or add that line to your
      ~/.valgrindrc file, which is the recommended way.

You will need procfs(5) enabled for all functionaly.
