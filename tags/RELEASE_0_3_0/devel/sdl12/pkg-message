 Your SDL library has been built with libvgl support, which means that you
 can run almost any SDL application straight on your console (VESA 2.0
 compatible videocard is required). To do this you have to enable VESA
 support in the kernel by adding "option VESA" into your kernel
 configuration file and set environment variable "SDL_VIDEODRIVER=vgl".
