BOUML is a free UML tool box (under development) allowing you to specify and
generate code in C++, Java, Idl, PHP and Python.

BOUML is extensible, and the external tools (named plug-outs) may be developed
in C++ or Java, using BOUML for their definition as any other program. The code
generators and reverses are ones of the pre-defined plug-outs  included in the
BOUML distribution.
