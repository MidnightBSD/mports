In order to use nautilus-cd-burner, you must make sure your CD devices
have the correct permissions.  You must also make sure you have:

device		atapicam

Configured in your kernel if you are using an ATAPI CD/DVD writer.
To figure out which CD/DVD drive you will be using, run the following
command as root:

camcontrol devlist

Your output will look similar to the following:

<CREATIVE CD5233E-N 0.20>          at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (cd0,pass0)

The devices in parenthesis at the end are important.  You must make sure
the /dev entries for those devices are writable by the users that will
be using nautilus-cd-burner.  In addition to those devices, /dev/xpt*
must also be writable to your nautilus-cd-burner users.
