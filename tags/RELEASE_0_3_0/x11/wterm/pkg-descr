wterm is an unofficial development branch of rxvt which adds NeXT 
style scrollbars, transparent backgrounds with optional shading, and 
other additions. Unlike many other efforts, wterm aims to have
its changed merged back into the parent rxvt rather than forking off 
yet another seperate terminal emulator.
