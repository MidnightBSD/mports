iSiloXC is the command-line tool for creating iSilo documents.
It takes as input a conversion list file that specifies the information
needed to create a set of documents.

iSiloXC converts text or HTML documents to the iSilo 3.x document format.
These can then be installed on a Palm Pilot, using tools in
the palm/pilot-link port.

These files are only readable using the iSilo reader,
available from the web site.

Main features:
 * text file formats: HTML, CSS, text, Palm Doc
 * image file formats: jpeg, gif, bmp, png
 * conversion from local or Web contents, multiple root sources
 * apply security attributes to converted documents
