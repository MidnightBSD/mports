Evolution Webcal installs a GNOME URL Handler for "webcal:".
This will pop up a subscription dialog when you point your web browser at it.
The calendars will automaticaly appear in Evolution 1.5.x if it is running,
or will show up the next time you start Evolution.

It also works for non-GNOME applications. These applications need to set
there URL handler to be "gnome-open".
