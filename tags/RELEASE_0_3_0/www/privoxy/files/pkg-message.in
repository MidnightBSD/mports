To start Privoxy on boot, add: privoxy_enable="YES"
to /etc/rc.conf.

To start Privoxy manually, run:
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/privoxy forcestart
The script understands most of the commands listed
in rc(8), it also contains a list of other rc
variables you can use.

Privoxy's example files were copied to:
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%

For documentation see:
%%DOCSDIR%%/user-manual or 'man privoxy'

Note that default.filter, standard.action and
default.action get overwritten with each Privoxy
update. Instead of changing them you should use
your own action and filter files as described in
Privoxy's manual.

If you installed Privoxy as package and are using the
default configuration, you have to make sure the
directories /var/log/privoxy and /var/run/privoxy
exist and are owned by privoxy:privoxy.
