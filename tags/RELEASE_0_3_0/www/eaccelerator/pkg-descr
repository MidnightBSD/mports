eAccelerator is a opcode cache for PHP. It increases
performance of PHP scripts by caching them in compiled state,
so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated.
Also it uses some optimizations for speed up of PHP scripts execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases
the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.

eAccelerator contains PHP encoder and loader. You can encode any PHP
scripts with encoder to distribute them without sources. Encoded files
can be run on any site which runs PHP with eAccelerator. The sources
of encoded script can't be restored because they are stored in a compiled
form and the encoded version doesn't contain the source.
