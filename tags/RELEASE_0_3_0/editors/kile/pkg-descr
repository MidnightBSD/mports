Kile (f/k/a Ktexmaker2) is a LaTeX source editor,
TeX shell and GnuPlot frontend. It is not (and will
never be) a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
interface for LaTeX; instead, its aim is to simplify
editing LaTeX source code and the use of
LaTeX-related programs for users who want to retain
control over their LaTeX documents.
