This package contains SGML formatting tools that were once a part
of the base FreeBSD distribution.  This port should be regarded
as a temporary solution to formatting SGML files until the
wrinkles in jade, a DSSSL processor, get ironed out.

If you are running FreeBSD 2.1.x, you should fetch the groff mm
macros from FreeBSD 2.2 or later because the macros in 2.1.x are
seriously broken.
