The GNU `dbm' is a library of database functions that use extendible
hashing and works similar to the standard UNIX `dbm' functions.
These routines are provided to a programmer needing to create and
manipulate a hashed database.

This library exists in the FreeBSD base collection, but the GNU
version has added functionality that is sometimes useful.
