# The purpose of this Makefile is to setup a standardized environment
# for making package splits.  Basically, for each split the organization
# looks like this:
#
#	src/release/scripts
#	ports/Tools/scripts/release
#		RELEASE (e.g. 4.6-RELEASE or 4.6-RC1)
#			symlinks to scripts required
#			directories used by scripts
#			config files
#
# The desire is to provide the scripts with the environment they
# expect while preserving the ability to cvs update them.
