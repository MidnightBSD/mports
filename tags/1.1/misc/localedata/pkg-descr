This package provides compatibility locale data for FreeBSD 6.x to run
4.x/5.x binaries. When you have a trouble with locale at running a legacy
binary, you should guide them to find legacy locale data with setting
PATH_LOCALE environment variable.

env PATH_LOCALE=/usr/local/share/compat/locale command
