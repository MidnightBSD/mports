`tnftp' (formerly lukemftp) is what many users affectionately call the enhanced
ftp client in NetBSD.

The enhancements over the standard ftp client in 4.4BSD include:
        * command-line editing within ftp
        * command-line fetching of URLS, including support for:
            - http proxies (c.f: $http_proxy, $ftp_proxy)
            - authentication
        * context sensitive command and filename completion
        * dynamic progress bar
        * IPv6 support (from the WIDE project)
        * modification time preservation
        * paging of local and remote files, and of directory listings
          (c.f: `lpage', `page', `pdir')
        * passive mode support, with fallback to active mode
        * `set option' override of ftp environment variables
        * socks4/socks5 support
        * TIS Firewall Toolkit gate ftp proxy support (c.f: `gate')
        * transfer-rate throttling (c.f: `-T', `rate')
