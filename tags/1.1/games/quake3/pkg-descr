Quake III Arena, developed by the gaming wizards at id Software,
is the third installment of one of the most popular computer game
franchises of all time. Organic caverns, gothic cathedrals and
futuristic spacescapes play host to Quake III Arena's unrivaled
blend of action, strategy and jaw-dropping technology as Linux
gamers are invited to square off against 32 of history's greatest
warriors. Built around a revolutionary new graphics engine capable
of delivering mind blowing 3D special effects including curved
surfaces and volumetric fog, Quake III Arena is the final word in
deathmatching mayhem.

This is a native build for BSD. Sorry, no joystick support
is available at this time.
