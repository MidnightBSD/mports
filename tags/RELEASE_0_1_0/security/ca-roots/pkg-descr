This port simply contains a list of SSL Certificate Authority root
certificates. Such a list performs a similar role for SSL Certificate
verfication that the root cache does for DNS servers.

This list originally came from mod_ssl (where it was ca-bundle.crt. They
originally got their list from Netscape Communicator/Navigator),
but will be maintained separately. The maintainer will apply strict
criteria to suggestions for additions to this list (in concert with
the FreeBSD security officer). CAs wishing to be added will need
to assure the FreeBSD user community that their certification procedures
are sufficiently secure to render their certificates trustworthy.
