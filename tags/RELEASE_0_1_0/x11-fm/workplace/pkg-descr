WorkPlace is a file manager and launcher which can copy files between another
instance of itself by drag-and-drop (not supported in this version) or change
permissions with one click.

If you try to set preferences, the program is likely to crash, either on exit
or immediately, possibly destroying your preference files.  I recommend
manually editing the WPPref and WPSuffix examples, then placing them in your
~/.workplace/.
