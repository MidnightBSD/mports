     o You can find the configuration files for this package in the
       directory %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid.
     
     o A cache directory has been created in %%PREFIX%%/squid/cache.
       Log files will be written to %%PREFIX%%/squid/logs.
     
       Note:
       You must initialize new cache directories before you can start
       Squid.  Do this by running "squid -z" as 'root' or '%%SQUID_UID%%'.
       If your cache directories are already initialized (e.g. after an
       upgrade of Squid) you do not need to initialize them again.

     o The default configuration will deny everyone access to the
       proxy service. Edit the "http_access" directives in
       %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf to suit your needs.

     Please note that the Squid start script is an rc.d style script.
     This means that Squid will not start automatically at boot time.

     To enable Squid, set squid_enable=yes in either
     /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/squid
     Please see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/squid(.sh) for further details.
