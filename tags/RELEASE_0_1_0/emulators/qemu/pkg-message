FreeBSD host notes:
- needs to run as root in order to use /dev/tap* networking 
or use sysctl net.link.tap.user_open 
to allow users to use it too.  don't forget to adjust device node
permissions in /etc/devfs.rules.)

- slirp (usermode networking) is fixed now in cvs, on FreeSBIE 1.0 guests
you still have to manually do:
	echo nameserver 10.0.2.3 >/etc/resolv.conf
but i've been told that that's normal. (fixed on FreeSBIE 1.1.)
and you have to wait a bit for dhclient to do its thing; traffic to
address 10.0.2.2 is routed to 127.1 on the host.

- expect timer problems when guest kernel HZ is > hosts,
for example time sleep 1 takes 49 seconds and booting sleeps for
minutes at the acd0 probe with a FreeSBIE 1.0 guest, thats because
its kernel is built with HZ=5000, and FreeBSD's default is 100...
(no longer a problem with FreeSBIE 1.1.)  The linux 2.6 kernel uses
1000 by default btw (changed to 250 recently).  Enabling /dev/rtc doesn't
seem to help either (not included since it needs a patch to emulators/rtc.)

- using physical media doesn't work on 4.x hosts (missing DIOCGMEDIASIZE
ioctl.)

- the -smb option (smb-export local dir to guest) needs the net/samba3
port/package installed in addition to qemu.

- if you want to use usb devices connected to the host in the guest
(usb_add host:... monitor command) you need to make sure the host isn't
claiming them, e.g. for umass devices (like memory sticks or external
harddrives) make sure umass isn't in the kernel (you can then still load it
as a kld when needed), also unless you are running qemu as root you then
need to fix permissions for /dev/ugen* device nodes: if you are on 5.x or
later (devfs) put a rule in /etc/devfs.rules, activate it in /etc/rc.conf
and run /etc/rc.d/devfs restart.  example devfs.rules:
	[ugen_ruleset=20]
	add path 'ugen*' mode 660 group operator
corresponding rc.conf line:
	devfs_system_ruleset="ugen_ruleset"

- still usb: since the hub is no longer attached to the uchi controller
and the wakeup mechanism, resume interrupt is not implemented yet linux
guests will suspend the bus, i.e. they wont see devices usb_add'ed after
its (linux') uhci module got loaded.  workaround: either add devices
before linux loads the module or rmmod and modprobe it afterwards.

- to avoid panics or non-working re(4) nics with FreeBSD guests if you
use qemu -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user or tap ... enable the emulated
rtl8139 timer by building the port with WITH_RTL8139_TIMER defined.
(the rtl8139c+ that model=rtl8139 emulates needs less cpu than qemu's
default ne2k nic which is driven by ed(4), it has not been made default
only because it may not work with all guests yet.)

IMPORTANT: (MidnightBSD)
If you receive an error message stating an invalid system call, you must have aio loaded.  
kldload aio will do this, although you should put the network stack under GIANT lock
using sysctl debug.mpsafenet=0
