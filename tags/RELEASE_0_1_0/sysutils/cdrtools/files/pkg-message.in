Note: The location of the cdrtools `defaults' files has been set to

	%%PREFIX%%/etc

This is the MidnightBSD ports standard config file location, NOT the cdrtools
standard location, which is /etc/default.

The reason for this is that MidnightBSD ports and packages should not use
configuration files outside of %%PREFIX%%.
