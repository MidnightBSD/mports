NodeBrain is an interpreter of a declarative rule-based language designed
for construction of state and event monitoring applications. It is an event
correlation engine that can interface with other monitoring components to make
rule-based decisions. For the purpose of generating event streams and
performing rule administration, it supports authenticated and encrypted
peer-to-peer communication over TCP/IP, including encrypted file transfers,
store-and-forward message queues, and remote command execution.
