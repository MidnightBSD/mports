LCMS is the Little Color Management System, a Color Matching Method
(CMM) library which implements fast transforms between ICC profiles.
It is released under LGPL with source code and meant to be portable.

Color management refers to techniques that ensure consistent color
as images are transferred from scanners or cameras to monitors and
printers.
