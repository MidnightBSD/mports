XDoclet is a Java code generation engine. It enables Attribute-Oriented
Programming for java. In short, this means that you can add more
significance to your code by adding meta data (attributes) to your java
sources. This is done in special JavaDoc tags.

XDoclet will parse your source files and generate many artifacts such as
XML descriptors and/or source code from it. These files are generated
from templates that use the information provided in the source code and
its JavaDoc tags.

XDoclet lets you apply Continuous Integration in component-oriented
development. Developers should concentrate their editing work on only
one Java source file per component.
