       PCCTS - The Purdue Compiler Construction Tool Set

   PCCTS is a set of public domain software tools designed to
facilitate  the  implementation  of  compilers  and  other
translation systems.  These tools currently include antlr,
and dlg.
   In many ways, PCCTS is similar to a highly integrated
version of YACC [Joh78] and LEX [Les75]; where antlr (ANother
Tool for Language Recognition) corresponds to YACC and dlg
(DFA-based Lexical analyzer Generator) functions like LEX.
   However, PCCTS  has  many  additional  features  which
make it easier to use for a wider range of translation
problems.
