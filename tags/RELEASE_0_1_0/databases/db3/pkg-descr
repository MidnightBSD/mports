Version 3 of the Berkeley DB library. This version uses an underlying
database format incompatible with revision 1 and a different standard API.
Utilities are included in the distribution to convert v1.85 databases to v3
databases, and a backwards compatible API is provided to maintain
compatibility with programs using the v1.85 interface.

There are minor interface changes in this release which may require that DB
applications be modified and recompiled. For a complete discussion of
interface changes, see:
