giFT no longer contains any protocol plugins. Please install the respective
ports: gift-fasttrack, gift-openft and gift-gnutella.

After installing giFT and OpenFT you'll need to set them up.
Be sure that you completely install any plugins you wish to use before this
step. If you decide that you later wish to add a new plugin, you will need to
re-run gift-setup after installation. Invocation of the setup tool is something
like this:
$ gift-setup

Note that giFT and OpenFT will not work with the default setup, so make sure you
read and understand all questions before answering or just pressing enter. To
reconfigure giFT and OpenFT later, just run gift-setup again.

If you want to run giFT from startup tweak and add the folowing variables to your 
/etc/rc.conf:

giftd_enable="YES"
# Run gift as (defaults to root, avoid this for security reasons)
giftd_user=""
# Path to giftd.conf (defaults to .giFT in the giftd_user home)
giftd_local_dir=""
