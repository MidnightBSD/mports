JadeTeX uses quite a lot of TeX's resources.  You may find it
necessary to increase the size of some of TeX's resource pools by
editing the file %%LOCALBASE%%/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf with any text
editor.

For example, to typeset the FreeBSD Handbook with JadeTeX, change the
following settings to the listed values:

	  hash_extra = 60000
	  save_size = 10000

If you change %%LOCALBASE%%/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, delete the word
"original" on line 1 of the file.  This will prevent future
installations of TeX from overwriting changes you've made.
