wmx10 is a companion to Tymm Twilliam's Bottlerocket software, which controls
X10's Firecracker Home Automation kit. The program is a WindowMaker/AfterStep
applet. It allows for turning off, turning on, dimming, and brightening of X10
modules via bottlerocket's functions. wmx10 controls one "house" at a time, up
to sixteen separate devices on each "house".
