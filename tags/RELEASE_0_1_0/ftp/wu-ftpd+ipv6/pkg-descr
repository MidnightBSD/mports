The package is linked dynamic so that you will get the right crypt
library.  If you are serious about performance, you may want to recompile
it by yourself (the port will link static by default).

wu-ftpd is a replacement ftp server for Un*x systems.  Besides
supporting the ftp protocol defined in RFC 959, it adds the following
features: logging of transfers, logging of commands, on the fly compression
and archiving, classification of users on type and location, per class limits,
per directory upload permissions, restricted guest accounts, system wide
and per directory messages, directory alias, cdpath, filename filter.

The configuration files are located in /usr/local/etc  This package includes
a basic working configuration.  The config files are:

  ftpaccess - controls who, what, and how many can access the server
  ftpconversions - controls the on-the-fly compression/archiving
  ftpusers - users who, for security reasons, may never use the server

You will also need to change /etc/inetd.conf to point to the new server 
located at /usr/local/libexec/ftpd
