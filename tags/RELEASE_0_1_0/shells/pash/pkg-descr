Pash 2.2 is a full screen shell, a Commander for Unix. The versions
distributed through this website are ports of Pash to PC Unix
Operating Systems.

The standard main screen displays 2 windows containing a listing of
the 2 current directories, a menu bar and a command line.

Pash can switch to a 4 window mode. Here's a view of this feature
along with part of the pull-down menu system. Selected files in each
window will be highlighted.

Besides all the classical file manipulation functions (copy, move,
...), Pash also acts as a shell, allowing you to control Processes and
IPC devices.
