Is there any reason why a shell (or command line) cannot be as
tolerant or as intelligent as a text adventure game like Zork, or a
MUD [Multi User Dungeon]? Is there any reason why a shell cannot work
like such a game? ("Go North", etc.) Actually, no and we have the
implementation to prove it. Have fun, and don't get eaten by a Grue!
