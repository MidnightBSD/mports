BIND 9 requires a good source of randomness to operate.
It also requires configuration of rndc, including a
"secret" key. 

If you are running BIND 9 in a chroot environment, make
sure that there is a /dev/random device in the chroot.

The easiest, and most secure way to configure rndc is
to run 'rndc-confgen -a' which will generate the proper
conf file, with a new random key, and appropriate file
permissions.
