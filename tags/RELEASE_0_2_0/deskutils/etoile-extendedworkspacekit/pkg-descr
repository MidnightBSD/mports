Etoile intends to be an innovative GNUstep based user environnement built
from the ground up on highly modular and light components with project and
document orientation in mind, in order to allow users to create their own
workflow by reshaping or recombining provided Services (aka Applications),
Components etc. Flexibility and modularity on both User Interface and code
level should allow us to scale from PDA to computer environment.

This package installs the ExtendedWorkspaceKit framework.
