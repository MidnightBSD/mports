This port has installed fonts into %%PREFIX%%/share/apps/konsole/fonts

You may want to add %%PREFIX%%/share/apps/konsole/fonts
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ %%PREFIX%%/share/apps/konsole/fonts
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/X11/xorg.conf or %%X11BASE%%/lib/X11/xorg.conf) and
restarting the X-server.

You also have to make the new path known to fontconfig by
adding a 

<dir>%%PREFIX%%/share/apps/konsole/fonts</dir> line to either

%%X11BASE%%/etc/fonts/local.conf or ~/.fonts.conf and running

fc-cache -f (as root if you edited local.conf) afterwards.
