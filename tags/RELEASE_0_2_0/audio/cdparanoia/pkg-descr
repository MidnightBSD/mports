Cdparanoia  is a  Compact  Disc Digital  Audio  (CDDA) extraction  tool,
commonly known on the net as a 'ripper'.
Cdparanoia is a  bit different than most other CDDA  extration tools. It
contains few-to-no  'extra' features, concentrating only  on the ripping
process and  knowing as much  as possible about the  hardware performing
it. Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio data from inexpensive
drives prone to misalignment, frame  jitter and loss of streaming during
atomic reads.  Cdparanoia will also read  and repair data from  CDs that
have been damaged in some way.
