Version 4 of the Berkeley DB library. This version uses an underlying
database format incompatible with revision 1 and a different standard API.
Utilities are included in the distribution to convert v1.85 databases to v4
databases, and a backwards compatible API is provided to maintain
compatibility with programs using the v1.85 interface.

For details on compatibility with other DB versions, see:
