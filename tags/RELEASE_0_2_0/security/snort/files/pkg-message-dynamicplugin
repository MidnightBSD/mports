NOTE: The port has been configured without support for dynamic plugins.
      It is recommended that you enable dynamic plugins by pressing
      Ctrl-C now, run 'make config' and enable the DYNAMIC option.

      If you choose not to enable dynamic plugins, the default Snort
      configuration file may reference some dynamic plugins and
      preprocessors that may cause Snort to not work properly or throw
      errors. Please read the Snort documentation for more information
      regarding dynamic plugins and which configuration directives
      are affected.
