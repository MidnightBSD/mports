To enable this port, add openssh_enable="YES" in your rc.conf. To
prevent conflict with openssh in the base system add sshd_enable="NO"
in your rc.conf.

'PermitRootLogin no' is the default for the OpenSSH port.
This now matches the PermitRootLogin configuration of OpenSSH in
the base system.  Please be aware of this when upgrading your
OpenSSH port, and if truly necessary, re-enable remote root login
by readjusting this option in your sshd_config.

Users are encouraged to create single-purpose users with ssh keys
and very narrowly defined sudo privileges instead of using root
for automated tasks.
