This is a Linux/i386 binary port of Pango.

from the home page:

	The goal of the Pango project is to provide an open-source
	framework for the layout and rendering of internationalized
	text.  Pango is an offshoot of the GTK+ and GNOME projects,
	and the initial focus is operation in those environments,
	however there is nothing fundamentally GTK+- or GNOME-specific
	about Pango.  Pango uses Unicode for all of its encoding,
	and will eventually support output in all the world's major
	languages.
