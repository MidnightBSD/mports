Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is available for
all common and most esoteric platforms and supports many different printers
and some displays.

Versions entitled "GNU Ghostscript" are distributed with the GNU General
Public License, which allows free use, and free copying and redistribution
under certain conditions (including, in some cases, commercial distribution).

This distribution is based on GNU Ghostscript and provides the "driver" for
CUPS that supports non-PostScript printer drivers within CUPS.
