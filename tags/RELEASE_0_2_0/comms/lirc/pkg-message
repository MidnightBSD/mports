**********************************************************************
This port does not contain any FreeBSD device drivers for infrared
devices. This port installs the LIRC daemons and tools for interacting
with drivers that support the LIRC device interface.

You will need to obtain third party device drivers or port the Linux
drivers in ${WRKSRC}/drivers to use the LIRC port.
