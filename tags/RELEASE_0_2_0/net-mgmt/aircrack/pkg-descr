aircrack is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks:

    * airodump: 802.11 packet capture program
    * aireplay: 802.11 packet injection program
    * aircrack: static WEP and WPA-PSK key cracker
    * airdecap: decrypts WEP/WPA capture files
    * arpforge: forges ARP packets

At the moment airodump and aireplay cannot be built on MidnightBSD.
