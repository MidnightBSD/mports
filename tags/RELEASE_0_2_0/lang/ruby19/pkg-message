Note that some of the standard libraries are provided as separate
ports since they require extra dependencies:

	converters/ruby-iconv	iconv module

	databases/ruby-gdbm:	GDBM module

	x11-toolkits/ruby-tk:	Tcl/Tk modules
	x11-toolkits/ruby-tk-jp:	Tcl/Tk modules for Japanized Tcl/Tk

Install them as occasion demands.
