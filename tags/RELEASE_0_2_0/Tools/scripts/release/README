$FreeBSD: ports/Tools/scripts/release/README,v 1.6 2002/05/20 08:29:21 will Exp $

This directory contains the scripts that are used to break up the packages
for a given release, so that they fit on a particular 4 CD set.  They rely
on src/release/scripts/print-cdrom-packages.sh to give preference for
particular packages to be located on particular CDs.

The approximate procedure is:

1) CVSROOT/avail lockout
2) cvs rtag RELEASE_4_5_0 ports

PWD=`pwd`
1) cd $PWD && cvs co -d srcscripts src/release/scripts
   OR
   cd $PWD/srcscripts && cvs up -dP
2) cd $PWD && cvs co -d releng ports/Tools/scripts/release
   OR
   cd $PWD/releng && cvs up -dP
3) cd $PWD/releng
4) make RELEASE=4.6-RELEASE SRCSCRIPTDIR=${PWD}/srcscripts
5) cd 4.6-RELEASE
6) ./doit.sh <path to ports/packages to split>
   [ answer prompts and stuff as it appears ]

More documentation to come later.
