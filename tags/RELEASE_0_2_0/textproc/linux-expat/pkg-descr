This is a Linux/i386 binary port of Expat.

from the README:

	This is Expat, a C library for parsing XML, written by James
	Clark.  Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser.  This means
	that you register handlers with the parser before starting
	the parse.  These handlers are called when the parser
	discovers the associated structures in the document being
	parsed.  A start tag is an example of the kind of structures
	for which you may register handlers.
