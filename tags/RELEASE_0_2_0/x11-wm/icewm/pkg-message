IceWM has been installed.

If you want a set of icons to use with IceWM see:

* http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/iceicons/

If you want more themes see:

* http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/925/

If you do not see icons in the tray when they should be there, please try
rebuilding with the "IMLIB" option enabled.

Graphical configuration tools for IceWM are outdated and obsolete, but there
is a useful menu generator in the ports tree: "deskutils/menumaker".
