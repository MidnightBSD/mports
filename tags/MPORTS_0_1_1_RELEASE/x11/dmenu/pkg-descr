dmenu is a minimalistic X11 menu. It reads a newline separated list of items
from stdin and shows them as a menu on the top of the screen. When the user
selects one item or types any text and presses Enter, his choice is printed to
stdout.

dmenu was developed as an addition to the dwm window manager, but can be used
in any X11-environment.
