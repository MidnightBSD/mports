======================================================================

SMB issues:
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

SFTP:
Only sftp access using public key authentication works.  To easily
setup public key authentication to "remote_host":

ssh-keygen -t dsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH sever on remote_host must allow pub key authentication.
