wmlpq is a Windowmaker dockapp which monitors up to 5 printqueues,
allowing you to see when your print job has finally been printed.
This is useful when you work in a networked environment with several
printers available, which are not in the same room; or (in some
cases) the same country, and is easier than typing lpq every 30
seconds.

Currently it requires that you are running a print server that can
emulate either BSD lpd or SysV lpsched. Experimental support for
cups and pdq is now included. It will display 8 LEDs for each of
up to 5 different printqueues; jobs are shown as green LEDs if
owned by you, red if owned by somebody else, and they move to the
left as they move up the queue.
