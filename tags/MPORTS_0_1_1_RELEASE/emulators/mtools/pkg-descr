Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to allow Unix systems
to read, write, and manipulate files on an MSDOS filesystem (typically
a diskette).  Each program attempts to emulate the MSDOS equivalent
command as closely as practical.

The following MSDOS commands are emulated:

Mtool           MSDOS
name            equivalent      Description
-----           ----            -----------
mattrib         ATTRIB          change MSDOS file attribute flags
mcd             CD              change MSDOS directory
mcopy           COPY            copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
mdel            DEL/ERASE       delete an MSDOS file
mdir            DIR             display an MSDOS directory
mformat         FORMAT          add MSDOS filesystem to a low-level format
mlabel          LABEL           make an MSDOS volume label.
mmd             MD/MKDIR        make an MSDOS subdirectory
mrd             RD/RMDIR        remove an MSDOS subdirectory
mread           COPY            low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix
mren            REN/RENAME      rename an existing MSDOS file
mtype           TYPE            display contents of an MSDOS file
mwrite          COPY            alias for mcopy, will be removed soon

You should be able to just close your eyes and pretend you're on an MSDOS
system.  Everything should work the same... except for the added 'm' at
the beginning of each command.

MSDOS filenames are optionally composed of a drive letter followed by
a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename.  Sub- directory names can use
either the '/' or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or
wildcards will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
them from the shell.

The regular expression "pattern matching" routines follow the
Unix-style rules.  For example, '*' matches all MSDOS files in lieu of
'*.*'.  The archive, hidden, read-only and system attribute bits are
ignored during pattern matching.
