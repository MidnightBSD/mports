This port contains a driver for several Winmodems based on the Lucent LT
chipset. It consists of a shim for the Linux binary only object file.

I have tested this code on a Dell Inspiron 8000, and a Mitsubishi Diamond Voice
internal PCI modem. Mr Watanabe has tested it on a ThinkPad i1124.

The shim code was written Watanabe Kiyoshi <aab10490@pop16.odn.net.jp>
