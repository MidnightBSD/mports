from the readme.txt:

	L0phtCrack 1.5 is a tool for turning Microsoft LANMAN and
	NT password hashes back into the original clear text
	passwords.  The program does this using dictionary cracking
	and also brute force.  L0phtCrack 1.5 returns not just the
	LANMAN password but the NT password up to 14 characters in
	length.

	L0phtCrack 1.5 includes the ability to dictionary attack
	or brute force the network NT server challenge that is used
	to prevent the OWF from going across the wire in its
	plain-text format.  Sample network sniffed challenges are
	in files sniff.txt and sniff2.txt.  This means you can get
	NT passwords without administrator privileges if you have
	network access between the client and the server.
