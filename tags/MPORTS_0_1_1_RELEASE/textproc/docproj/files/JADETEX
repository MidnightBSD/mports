This port will try and ensure that the tools used by the FreeBSD
Documentation Project are installed on your system so you can convert
documentation from SGML to other formats.

One of these components is JadeTeX, which depends on teTeX. The source
for teTeX is larger than 30MB, and may be a very long download for you.

If you do not want to produce PostScript and PDF formats from the 
documentation then you do not need JadeTeX, and you should set the
variable "WITH_JADETEX" to "no". If you do want to produce PostScript and
PDF output then set "WITH_JADETEX" to yes.

For example;

    make WITH_JADETEX=no
    make WITH_JADETEX=yes
