** PLEASE NOTE Macromedia Flash7 SUPPORT IS ALPHA+ VERSION. **

Flash7 support is unstable.  I know well that there are often
crashes or freezes with flash7.

Please get and apply a dlsym(3) hook patch.
	http://people.FreeBSD.org/~nork/rtld_dlsym_hack.diff
This provides _dlsym(3) function to fix dynamic-link
error "can't find gtk_major_version" ad-hoc-ly.

I don't set the default to use flash7.  Please set-up your
enviroment(ln -s, apply patch to rtld,...).

** PLEASE CONFIRM YOUR /etc/libmap.conf ***

Setup your /etc/libmap.conf.  Please SEE ALSO following file.
==> %%LIBMAPCONF%%

Now start browser and go to 'about:plugins' and the new plugins
are enabled!
