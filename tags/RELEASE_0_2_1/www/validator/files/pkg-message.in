The W3C Markup Validation Service has been installed.  However, it will not
do anything until you set up your web server to utilize it.  Below is an
Apache configutation snippet that you can put into your httpd.conf to
utilize the validator.  If you are using another web server, you will have
to configure it yourself.  The W3C only recommends the use of the Apache
web server, so there are no other web server configuration snippets.

A sample validator.conf has been installed at
%%PREFIX%%/www/validator/htdocs/config/validator.conf.sample
You need to copy this file to /etc/w3c/validator.conf and then edit it to
your liking.  If you have used a previous version of the validator, you
will need to manually check if anything new has been added to the W3C's
validator.conf and edit your own validator.conf accordingly.

# Example httpd.conf snippet for W3C Markup Validation Service
# Note that this is not a complete server configuration file, but contains
# only the validator-specific part.
#
# You can use the Include directive for including this in your main httpd.conf.
#
# Note: running the validator under mod_perl is not supported at the moment.
#       You are also required to have mod_include active for the validator
#       pages to show up as they should.
#
# The /w3c-validator loaction can be changed to whatever you want it to be,
# but make sure you change it for both of these ScriptAlias commands as well
# as the Alias command under them.

# First, tell httpd that check and sendfeedback.pl are CGI scripts.

ScriptAlias      /w3c-validator/check \
  %%PREFIX%%/www/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check
ScriptAliasMatch /w3c-validator/feedback(\.html)? \
  %%PREFIX%%/www/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/sendfeedback.pl

# This is the directory where you have the validator's *.html, *.css etc files.

Alias /w3c-validator/   %%PREFIX%%/www/validator/htdocs/
<Directory %%PREFIX%%/www/validator/htdocs/>
  Options               IncludesNOEXEC Indexes MultiViews
  AllowOverride         None
  AddHandler            server-parsed .html
  AddCharset            utf-8         .html
</Directory>
