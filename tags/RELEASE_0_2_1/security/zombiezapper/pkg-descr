Zombie Zapper works against Trinoo, TFN, and Stacheldraht. Assuming
that the default passwords have not been changed, you can simply use
the same commands that an attacker would use to stop the flood. On
Trinoo, it does stop the daemon entirely (although it is typically
set to be restarted by cron, silently awaiting more commands), but
on TFN and Stacheldraht the flooding just stops. This gives you the
advantage of telling the daemon to stop flooding without stopping
the daemon, allowing you to take a little more time in tracking down
where they are, and more importantly, how they got there in the first
place.
