Asmodem displays the modem status in an Afterstep type window.  It was
adapted from asmail.  It indicates the status of your modem with 3
blinking lights that indicate when the modem is connected, transmitting, 
and receiving.  It is especially useful for internal modems.
It can execute programs to dial, re-dial, and hang-up when clicked on.
It only works on device ppp0.
