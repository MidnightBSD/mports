Valgrind is a system for debugging and profiling un*x programs. With the tools
that come with Valgrind, you can automatically detect many memory management
and threading bugs, avoiding hours of frustrating bug-hunting, making your
programs more stable. You can also perform detailed profiling, to speed up and
reduce memory use of your programs.

The Valgrind distribution includes five tools: two memory error detectors, a
thread error detector, a cache profiler and a heap profiler. Several other
tools have been built with Valgrind.

Valgrind was ported to FreeBSD by Doug Rabson (http://www.rabson.org/).
