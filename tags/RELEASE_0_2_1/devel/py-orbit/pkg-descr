To paraphase the README:

This is a Python language binding for the ORBit2 CORBA implementation.
It aims to take advantage of new features found in ORBit2 to make
language bindings more efficient.  This includes:
  - Use of ORBit2 type libraries to generate stubs
  - use of the ORBit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation
    invocation, which allows for short circuited invocation on local
    objects.
