To use these drivers, make sure that you have loaded the nvidia kernel
module, by doing

	# kldload nvidia

or adding

	nvidia_load="YES"

to your /boot/loader.conf.

If you build this port with WITH_FREEBSD_AGP=yes, make sure you have
agp.ko kernel module installed and loaded, since nvidia.ko will depend
on it, or have your kernel compiled with "device agp".  Otherwise the
nvidia kernel module will not load.  Also, care to specify correct
``Option "NvAGP"'' in ``Device'' section of your X11 configuration file.

When building with Linux compatibility (WITH_LINUX=yes), make sure
linux.ko is available as well (or have it compiled in kernel).  It can
be loaded via /boot/loader.conf (or later in boot process if you add

	linux_enable="YES"

to your /etc/rc.conf.

Note that this driver does not support PAE-enabled kernels.

If X.org cannot start and reports

	(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to obtain a shared memory identifier.

in /var/log/Xorg.0.log while actually you have ``options SYSVSHM''
enabled in kernel, the sysctl ``kern.ipc.shmall'' should be increased.

See %%DOCSDIR%%/README for more information.
