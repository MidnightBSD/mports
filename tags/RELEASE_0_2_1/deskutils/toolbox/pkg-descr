Toobox is a collection of tools. Each tool is in the form of bundle. In a
given category, you can add new items. Each item contains the value of
location and of bundle (tool). Depending on the location, items can have
different contents even with the same bundle. Conceptually, it is similar
to the bookmark. It does not only store the location, but also the tool to
access the location. The item is not supposed to change its location
frequently. It is designed to access the fixed location, either on file
system or over internet. Some items don't access any location, such as
calculator.
