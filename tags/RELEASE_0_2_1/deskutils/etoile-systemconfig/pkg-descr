SystemConfig is a framework which provides various a common way to set system 
specific preferences by interfacing with the host system. Host system means the 
following combo:
        * operating sytem
        * additional abstraction support (sound, network etc.)
        * display/window server
Versatile and flexible devices support is often done through an extra 
abstraction layer/library on top of the kernel. This is what 'additional 
abstraction support' means. GNOME System tools backend is an example of such
library that allows to set various settings (like network related ones) without
having to pay attention on which operating system Etoile is used.
