# legal-packages.sh - D. Adam Karim
#
# This script goes through the built packages on a system and verifies that
# those packages do not violate any copyright or export laws. The script
# uses LEGAL in order to verify this. This script is by no means a panacea;
# as such, I cannot verify that all packages that are not in LEGAL are
# allowed to be distrubted or exported. This is only meant to be a tool to
# aid in the endeavor to fallow good legal practices. If any packages are
# found to be violating any laws, please email archite@midnightbsd.org and
# we will add it to our LEGAL file.
