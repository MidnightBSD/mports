   phpMyAdmin handles the administration of MySQL over the Web. It can
   manage a whole MySQL server as well as a single database.

   Currently phpMyAdmin can:
     - easily browse through databases and tables
     - create, copy, rename, alter and drop databases
     - create, copy, rename, alter and drop tables
     - do table maintenance
     - add, edit and drop fields
     - execute any SQL-statement, even multiple queries
     - create, alter and drop indexes
     - load text files into tables
     - create (*) and read dumps of tables or databases
     - export (*) data to SQL, CSV, XML, Word, Excel, PDF and Latex
       formats
     - administer multiple servers
     - manage MySQL users and privileges
     - check server settings and runtime information with
       configuration hints
     - check referential integrity in MyISAM tables
     - using Query-by-example (QBE), create complex queries
       automatically connecting required tables
     - create PDF graphics of your Database layout
     - search globally in a database or a subset of it
     - transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined
       functions, like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link
     - support InnoDB tables and foreign keys (see FAQ 3.6)
     - support mysqli, the improved MySQL extension (see FAQ 1.17)
     - communicate in 50 different languages

   (*) phpMyAdmin can compress (Zip, GZip -RFC 1952- or Bzip2 formats)
   dumps and CSV exports if you use PHP4 >= 4.0.4 with Zlib support
   (--with-zli b) and/or Bzip2 support (--with-bz2).
