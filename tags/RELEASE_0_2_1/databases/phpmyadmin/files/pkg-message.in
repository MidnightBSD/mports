Please edit config.inc.php to suit your needs.

To make phpMyAdmin available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /phpmyadmin/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%MYADMDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%PREFIX%%/%%MYADMDIR%%/">
	Options none
	AllowOverride Limit
	
	Order Deny,Allow
	Deny from all
	Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>
