Version 4.4 of the Berkeley Data Base library which offers (key/value) storage
with optional concurrent access or transactions interface.

This port will install the AES (American Encryption Standard) enabled version.

Utilities are included in the distribution to convert v1.85 databases to v4.4
databases, and a backwards compatible API is provided to maintain compatibility
with programs using the v1.85 interface.

For details on compatibility with other DB versions, see:
