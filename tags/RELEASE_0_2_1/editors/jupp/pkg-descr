This is the portable version of JOE?s Own Editor, which is currently developed at sourceforge, licenced under the GNU General Public License, Version 1, using autoconf/automake. This version has been enhanced by several functions intended for programmers or other professional users, and has a lot of bugs fixed. It is based upon an older version of joe because these behave better overall.
jupp also does come with the editor flavours known from joe, specifically, jmacs, joe, jpico, jstar, and rjoe. Not all features of jupp are available for these though (but all the bugfixes, and syntax highlighting is still enabled by default for these, while it is not auto-enabled in jupp).

Kudos to Joe H. Allen for bringing me a better WordStar?-compatible editor than Intergalactic Digital Research, DR Editor R2.00, DR DOS 5 (and its predecessor from DR DOS 3.41).
