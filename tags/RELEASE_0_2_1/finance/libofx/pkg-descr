LibOFX is an API designed to allow applications to very easily support
OFX command responses, usually provided by financial institutions.

LibOFX was implemented directly from the full OFX 1.6 spec, and
currently supports:
-Banking transactions and statements
-Credit card and statements
                                                                                
For the 1.0 release, it should also support:
-Header parsing
-DTD autodetection
-OFX 2.0
-Currency conversion

Somewhere in the future:
-investment transactions.

You should read the file doc/implementation_notes.txt
                                                                                
This is an ALPHA release.  It really works and is not vaporware, but the
API is still subject to change, and several OFX structures are not fully
implemented, notably currency conversions and the <PAYEE> aggregate.
