libpcap is a ubiquitous network traffic capture library used by a wide
variety of BSD, Linux and UN*X applications.

Whilst FreeBSD has a vendor branch import of libpcap in its source tree,
the purpose of the port is to provide a means of offering additional,
bleeding-edge features which might not make it into the tree.
