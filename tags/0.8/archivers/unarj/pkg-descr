This is an extract-only program which allows access to the contents of ARJ 
archives. You cannot specify a base directory or select individual files 
to extract.  UNARJ does not support empty directories or volume labels.  
UNARJ is much slower than ARJ because ARJ is highly optimized using 
assembly language.
