Mg is a small, fast, portable, and free (public domain) Emacs-like
editor maintained by the OpenBSD Project.  It is intended for people
who can't, or don't want to, run the real GNU Emacs, or are not
familiar with the vi(1) editor.

Although it is intended to be largely compatible with GNU Emacs, Mg
doesn't have special modes for tasks other than editing plain text.
Moreover, since it is written entirely in C, there is no language in
which to write extensions in (read: no builtin Lisp interpreter).

If you are looking for something that looks like Emacs (don't want to
learn another editor) but don't have the resources to run the latter,
this may be what you're looking for.

Enjoy!
