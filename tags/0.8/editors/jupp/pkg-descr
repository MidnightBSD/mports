This is the portable version of JOE's Own Editor, which is currently 
developed at sourceforge, licenced under the GNU General Public License, 
Version 1, using autoconf/automake. This version has been enhanced by 
several functions intended for programmers or other professional users, 
and has a lot of bugs fixed. It is based upon an older version of joe 
because these behave better overall.

jupp also does come with the editor flavours known from joe, 
specifically, jmacs, joe, jpico, jstar, and rjoe. Not all features 
of jupp are available for these though (but all the bugfixes, and 
syntax highlighting is still enabled by default for these, while it 
is not auto-enabled in jupp).

Kudos to Joe H. Allen for bringing me a better WordStar?-compatible 
editor than Intergalactic Digital Research, DR Editor R2.00, 
DR DOS 5 (and its predecessor from DR DOS 3.41).
