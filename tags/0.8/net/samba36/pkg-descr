The Samba suite is a set of programs which run under the FreeBSD
operating system. These programs deliver most of the important
functionality of a Microsoft Lan Manager server. That is, they support
remote access to FreeBSD filespace and FreeBSD printers from Lan Manager
compatible clients. In practical terms, this means that such clients can
connect to and use FreeBSD filespace as if it was a local disk drive, or
FreeBSD printers as if they were local printers.

Some of the most popular Lan Manager compatible clients include Lan
Manager itself, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Windows NT.
