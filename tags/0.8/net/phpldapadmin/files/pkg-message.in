%%PKGNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%

Please edit config.php to suit your needs.

To make phpLDAPadmin available through your web site, I suggest that
you add something like following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /phpldapadmin/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/htdocs"

    <Directory "%%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/htdocs">
        Options none
        AllowOverride none

        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
        Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>

Please note: if you are upgrading from version 0.9.7 or earlier, the
layout of the %%PKGNAME%% files has been completely reworked. You will
need to modify your apache configuration and merge the settings from
your original configuration file:

    %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/config.php

 to

   %%PREFIX%%/%%PLADIR%%/config/config.php
