A library that allows you to load GLADE interfaces at runtime (you don't
have to generate stubs with GLADE before hand). This way you can change
the look of your application without recompiling. This way you can write
the logic behind the interface separately from the code to build the
interface, so changing the interface is not so much of a problem.
