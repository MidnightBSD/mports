# script to run PHPlist from commandline. You may need to edit this to make it work
# with your shell environment. The following should work for Bash on Fedora Linux
# but this may vary strongly in other situations. You will need to dig into the
# code to make sure it works for you.

# in commandline mode, access is restricted to users who are listed in the config file
# check README.commandline for more info

# identify the config file for your installation
CONFIG=%%WWWDIR%%/lists/config/config.php
export CONFIG

# alternatively you can use -c <path to config file> on the commandline

# run the PHPlist index file with all parameters passed to this script
exec %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/php %%WWWDIR%%/lists/admin/index.php $*
