Mounting Fuse File Systems with HAL
-----------------------------------

$FreeBSD: ports/sysutils/hal/files/README.fuse,v 1.1 2009/01/10 05:21:51 marcus Exp $

Hal supports mounting Fuse device-backed file systems (e.g. NTFS).  To enable
this feature, copy the included %%LOCALBASE%%/share/hal/mount-fuse script
to /sbin.  Make sure this script is executable.  Edit the script, and change
the FUSE_HELPER environment variable to the name of the executable which
will actually mount the Fuse volume (e.g. for NTFS, this is ``ntfs-3g'').

Finally, the script must be renamed to ``mount_FSNAME''.  FSNAME is the name
of the file system type (e.g. for NTFS, this is ``ntfs'').  If there is
already an executable in /sbin or /usr/sbin with this name, the
existing executable must be renamed or deleted.

As is stated in the examples above, overriding FreeBSD's existing NTFS
support with Fuse's ntfs-3g is the most common use case for this.  The
ntfs-3g Fuse driver uses different mount options than FreeBSD's included
mount_ntfs.  GNOME transparently supports switching between ntfs and
ntfs-3g.  Simply edit the following GConf key in the GNOME
Configuration Editor (i.e. gconf-editor):

/system/storage/default_options/ntfs/fstype_override

Set the value to ``ntfs-3g'', then add your desired ntfs-3g options to the
following GConf key:

/system/storage/default_options/ntfs-3g/mount_options

Other desktop systems may have similar options.
