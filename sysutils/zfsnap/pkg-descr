zfSnap is simple sh script to make rolling zfs snapshots with cron. Main
advantage of zfSnap is that it's written in %100 pure /bin/sh, doesn't
require any additional software to run, and is simple to use.

zfSnap keeps all information about snapshot in snapshot name. zfs snapshot
names are in form: Timestamp--TTL where timestamp is date and time of
snapshot creation and TTL is Time To Live in human readable form.
