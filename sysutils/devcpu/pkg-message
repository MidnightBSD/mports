CPU kernel module was installed.

To load it, issue

% kldload cpu

Then you can access MSR registers or cpuid info via /dev/cpu%d or using
3d-party programs, e.g. x86info.

For information regarding microcode update features refer to
cpu_microcode_tool(4) manpage.

You might be interested in enabling automatic microcode update on startup.
This can be achieved by adding the line devcpu_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf.
Refer to rcNG devcpu script for additional info.

You can also use extract_mcodes.rb utility to extract cpucode updates
from vendor-supplied BIOS updates. The utility currently supports only
Award/Phoenix-compatible BIOS images.

Please, report any problems to maintainer. Thanks!
