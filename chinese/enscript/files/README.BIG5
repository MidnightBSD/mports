Sept. 9 2000:

This version of enscript is patched by Chen-Shan Chin
(cschin@u.washington.edu) to support BIG5 and UniCNS-UTF8
encoded text file.  Two new encoding name "big5" and 
"UniCNS-UTF8" are added.  Since there is no easy way to
get AFM for CJK CID-font, I simply assign the width for
the same for all character.

You need to have a CID-font for these encoding to use 
this function.
