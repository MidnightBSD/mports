The settings manager provides the MCS (Multi-Channel Settings), a
modular, host independent, network transparent and centralized
configuration system. It runs in the background and provides global
settings information to other Xfce components. There is a main control
panel to access the configuration dialogs of all the components. The
MCS plugins provide settings dialogs for general items that are not
part of a package, e.g. GTK, mouse, fonts, keyboard, and display
settings.
