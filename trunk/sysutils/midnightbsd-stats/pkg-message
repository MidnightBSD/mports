This script, meant to be run monthly, submits statistics anonymously
to a checkin server (http://rpt.midnightbsd.org), in an attempt to
generate reasonably accurate demographics of MidnightBSD usage and
hardware.

To enable monthly reporting, edit or create /etc/periodic.conf and 
add this line:
	monthly_statistics_enable="YES"

To enable boottime reporting, edit or create /etc/rc.conf and add 
this line:
 	midnightbsd_stats_enable="YES"

To enable device reporting, add this line:
	monthly_statistics_report_devices="YES"

To enable ports reporting, add this line:
	monthly_statistics_report_ports="YES"

To run it manually the first time, just run it as:
	/usr/local/etc/periodic/monthly/310.statistics -nodelay

To view current statistics, go to:
        http://rpt.midnightbsd.org
