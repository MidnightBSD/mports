StarOffice 7.0 Personal Install How-To

Written by:   Martin Blapp <mb@imp.ch>

------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:

If a user installation fails, just restart it. It will
work the second time. Remove then your $HOME/staroffice7.0
directory and the line beginning with "StarOffice 7.0" in
your $HOME/.sversionrc and restart the installation.

------------------------------------------------------------------

You will very shortly have finished  a network install of
StarOffice 7.0. Once that is done exit X11 and run it again as
the user that you usually use. There are some wrappers
installed in $PREFIX. Run "staroffice7" and begin a standard
workstation install. 

It will then be ready to use.

Good Luck
