WMII is a dynamic window manager for X11.  It supports classic and dynamic
window management with extended keyboard, mouse, and filesystem based remote
control.  It replaces the workspace paradigm with a new tagging approach.

Its minimalist philosophy attempts to not exceed 10.000 lines of code
(including all shipped utilities and libraries), to enforce simplicity and
clarity.
