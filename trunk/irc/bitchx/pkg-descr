BitchX is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client by Colten Edwards aka
panasync@efnet, it is based on it's predecessors ircII and EPIC.
BitchX was originally started as a script by Trench and HappyCrappy
for the popular UNIX IRC client ircII. Around Christmas of 1994 the
script was patched directly into the client by panasync.
