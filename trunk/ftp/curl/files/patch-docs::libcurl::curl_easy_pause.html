 <p class="level0">NOTE: while it may feel tempting, take care and notice that you cannot call this function from another thread. 
 <p class="level0">When this function is called to unpause reading, the chance is high that you will get your write callback called before this function returns. 
 <p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">handle</span> argument is of course identifying the handle that operates on the connection you want to pause or unpause.

 <p class="level0">When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a write callback, the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it'll have to keep it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using this function. 
-<p class="level0">If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get uncompressed automatially on download, libcurl will continue to uncompress the entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data uncompressed. This has the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed a lot, it can result in a very large data amount needing to be allocated to save the data during the pause. This said, you should probably consider not using paused reading if you allow libcurl to uncompress data automatically. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
