XmlRpc++ is a C++ implementation of the XML-RPC protocol. The XmlRpc protocol
was designed to make remote procedure calls easy: it encodes data in a simple
XML format and uses HTTP for communication. XmlRpc++ is designed to make it
easy to incorporate XML-RPC client and server support into C++ applications.

Features:
    * Easy - This library is easy to incorporate into C++ applications. No
             other libraries are required, other than your system's socket
             libraries. Simple XML parsing and HTTP support are built in.
    * Fast - All IO is non-blocking, so a slow client or network will not
             slow down the server.
    * Portable - Written in standard C++ to the POSIX and Windows sockets
             APIs. You do need a fairly recent compiler (g++ 3.1 or
             MSVC++ .Net or MSVC++ 6 with the STL patches.)

    * Free - This library is released under the GNU LGPL.
