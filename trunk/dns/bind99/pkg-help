If using a chrooted instance of BIND, the OpenSSL engines
need to be accessible from within the chroot.  If BIND
is chrooted in /var/named, this can be achieved by either
copying content of /usr/local/lib/engines into
/var/named/usr/local/lib/engines, or by creating that
directory and adding this line to /etc/fstab:
/usr/local/lib/engines  /var/named/usr/local/lib/engines nullfs ro 0 0
