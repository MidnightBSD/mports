iSilo converts text or HTML documents to the Palm Pilot .pdb format.  These
can then be installed on a Palm Pilot, using tools in the palm/pilot-link
port.

These files are only readable using the iSilo reader, available from the
web site.  A free reader exists, as does a more featureful shareware 
reader.  Their primary advantages over other Palm Pilot DOC readers are

  1.  Internal links in the original HTML are maintained.

  2.  A reasonable facsimile of the original HTML formatting is maintained.

  3.  Images in the original HTML file are dithered and scaled, for viewing
      on the Pilot.
