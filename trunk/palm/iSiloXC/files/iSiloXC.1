It takes as input a conversion list file that specifies the information
needed to create a set of documents.
.Pp

.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl h | Fl ?
Display the
.Nm
usage help information.
.It Fl x Ar filename
Convert the documents specified in the conversion list file.
For the format of this file, see
.Xr ixl 5
file format.
.It Fl o Ar filename
Specify settings for additional options in the settings file
For the format of this file, see
.Xr ixl 5
file format.
.It Fl a Ar path
Specify the application directory that contains supporting files for 
.Nm .
One such supporting file is the html40.css file,
which specifies default HTML style settings.
If the application directory is not specified or if the application directory
does not have this file in its CSS subdirectory, then
.Nm
uses default HTML style settings.
.It Fl q
Specify quiet mode.
Quiet mode suppresses progress messages during conversion.
Note that this option does not suppress error messages and that
if you specify 
.Fl v
for verbose, it overrides the quiet option.
.It Fl v Ns Op Cm v
Use
.Fl v
to specify verbose mode or
.Fl vv
to specify very verbose mode. During conversion
.Nm
normally only outputs one line for each document in the document list.
The line shows the index of the document, the total number of documents
in the list, and the title of the document.
.Pp
In verbose mode,
.Nm
outputs the major steps of converting a document as it happens and also outputs path of each source file as it is processed.
.Pp
In very verbose mode,
.Nm
first outputs the options you have specified on the command line followed by
the settings and conversion list. Then during conversion,
.Nm
outputs more detailed progress information.
.It Fl u
Update the conversion status information for each document in the list.
This information includes the date and time of conversion,
the resulting document size, and whether the conversion was successful or not.
Note that if you specify this option,
.Nm
must be able to write to the conversion list file.
