 To use ViewVC modify the configuration file, located at
 %%INSTDIR%%/viewvc.conf.

 enable the standalone ViewVC server in rc.conf with the
 parameter viewvc_enable="YES". 

 You can also adjust the user wich runs the ViewVC standalone 
 server with the paramter viewvc_user.

 If you want to run the ViewVC standalone server with another 
 IP/PORT use the parameter viewvc_flags

 To see all aviable parameters use the command
 %%PREFIX%%/viewvc/bin/standalone.py --help
