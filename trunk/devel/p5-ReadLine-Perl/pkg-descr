Perl 5 ships with a module called Term::ReadLine which is an interface
to command line editing and recall.  The version that ships with Perl
is only a stub, and offers little functionality.

This module supplants the Term::ReadLine stubs with real command line
editing and recall facilities, written entirely in Perl.  Applications
that use Term::ReadLine do not need to be modified to gain the benefits
of this package; it will happen transparently upon installation.
