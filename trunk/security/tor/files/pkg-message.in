================================================================================
To enable the tor server, set tor_enable="YES" in your /etc/rc.conf
and edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/tor/torrc.  Note that the rc.subr script overrides
many torrc options and is tunable: see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/tor for details.
To use the torify script, install the net/torsocks port. After removing the
package, or updating to a new version, users may need to delete all files
in /var/db/tor.
