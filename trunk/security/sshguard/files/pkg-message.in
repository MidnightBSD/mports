  Sshguard installed successfully.

%%PKGMSG_FWBLOCK%%

  If you would like to use sshguard via syslogd, add an entry to your
  /etc/syslog.conf like the following:

    auth.info;authpriv.info     |exec %%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshguard

  and use "/etc/rc.d/syslogd reload" to activate it. Note, you can add
  additional arguments to the sshguard command if you so desire.

  Alternatively, you can also start sshguard as a daemon by using the
  rc.d script installed at %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sshguard .
  
  See sshguard(8) and http://sshguard.sourceforge.net for additional info.
