Version 4.2 of the Berkeley Data Base library which offers (key/value) storage
with optional concurrent access or transactions interface.

Utilities are included in the distribution to convert v1.85 databases to v4.2
databases, and a backwards compatible API is provided to maintain
compatibility with programs using the v1.85 interface.

Note that this port has a different layout than the 3.3, 4.0 and 4.1 ports,
it does not rename libraries.

For details on compatibility with other DB versions, see:
