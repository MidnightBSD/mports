Subject: [PATCH 36/40] dbe: Call to DDX SwapBuffers requires address of int,
 not unsigned int [CVE-2014-8097 pt. 2]

When the local types used to walk the DBE request were changed, this
changed the type of the parameter passed to the DDX SwapBuffers API,
but there wasn't a matching change in the API definition.

At this point, with the API frozen, I just stuck a new variable in
with the correct type. Because we've already bounds-checked nStuff to
be smaller than UINT32_MAX / sizeof(DbeSwapInfoRec), we know it will
fit in a signed int without overflow.
