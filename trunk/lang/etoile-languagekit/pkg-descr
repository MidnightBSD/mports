LanguageKit is a compiler kit built on top of LLVM for creating dynamic
language implementations using an Objective-C runtime for the object model.
This is used by SmalltalkKit, implementing Etoile's Pragmatic Smalltalk,
a Smalltalk JIT compiler which generates code binary-compatible with
Objective-C, allowing classes to be written in a mixture of Smalltalk
and Objective-C.
