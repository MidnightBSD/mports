# CCFLAGS is the scons equivalent of CFLAGS. So we should bring in our
# FreeBSD CFLAGS.
#
# LINKFLAGS is equivalent to LDFLAGS in make speak, so we bring in the
# FreeBSD default LDFLAGS.
#
# Some scons projects may honor PKGCONFIGDIR, which tells them where to
# look for, and install, pkgconfig files.
#
# LIBPATH is the search path for libraries. Bring in some safe defaults.
#
# CPPPATH is the search path for includes, Again, bring in some safe defaults.

#
# SCONS_ENV is where we pass all the stuff that should be the
# same for any scons port to scons. Things like CCFLAGS, and LINKFLAGS
# go here.
#
# SCONS_ARG is where you pass port specific scons flags to the scons
# enviornment.
#
# SCONS_BUILDENV is where you pass variables you want to be in the
# System Enviornment instead of the SCons Enviornment.
#
# SCONS_TARGET is the same as MAKE_TARGET it is passed as the last
# argument to scons.
