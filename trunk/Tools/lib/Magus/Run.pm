=head2 Magus::Run->latest($machine)

Takes a machine, and returns the latest run for that machine's osversion and arch.

=cut

sub latest {
  my ($class, $machine) = @_;
  
  return $class->search(
    osversion => $machine->osversion,
    arch      => $machine->arch,
    { order_by => 'id DESC' }
  )->next;
}


=head2 $run->is_empty();

Returns true if the run has no ports left to be tested

=cut

sub is_empty {
  my ($self) = @_;
  
  return Magus::Port->get_ready_port($self) ? 0 : 1;
}


=head2 $run->tarball

Returns the run's tarball filename (no path)

=cut

sub tarball {
  my ($self) = @_;
  my $id = $self->id;
  
  return "mports-tree-$id.tar.bz2"
}

=head2 $run->tarballpath

Returns the absolute path to the tarball (including scp information if you're
on a node).  This is implemented as:

 "$Magus::Config{MasterDataDir}/$Magus::Conig{MportsSnapDir}/" . $run->tarball

=cut

sub tarballpath {
  return "$Magus::Config{MasterDataDir}/$Magus::Conig{MportsSnapDir}/" . shift->tarball;
}
