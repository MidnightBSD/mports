This is just some rough notes on the design on magus.  It is in cvs for
backing up and so that other interested contributers can see what I am
thinking.  

Tests ports, /and/ makes packages.


Master machine.

No NFS mount - we have a distributed build cluster.
Mysql used to track locks, the priority queue, and tested ports.
Some how needs to track when ports are updated.  cvs of course.  Push or
pull?


Slaves:
LOCK TABLE test_queue WRITE
LOCK TABLE locks WRITE
SELECT * FROM test_queue WHERE arch=$my_arch ORDER BY priority LIMIT 1;
DELETE FROM test_queue WHERE id=$last_select;
INSERT INTO locks (port,arch) VALUES ($port->name, $my_arch)
UNLOCK TABLE test_queue
UNLOCK TABLE locks

setup_chroot();
test_port($port);
clear_chroot();

LOCK TABLE locks WRITE
DELETE FROM locks WHERE port=$port AND arch=$my_arch
UNLOCK TABLE locks;

sub test_port {

	for $depend ($port->all_depends) {
		if (master_has_package($depend, $my_arch)) {
			install_package_from_master($depend, $my_arch))
		} else {
			test_port($depend);
		}
	}

	chroot_and_install($port);
	upload_pkg_to_master($port);
	report_results($port)
}
