MathArray is a general library of classes for performing mathematical
operations on arrays (vectors, matrices, etc) of values. It can
operate on any standard 'C' number type plus numbers of complex
type. MathArray is implemented using a "class cluster" concept,
allowing one to perform mathematical calculations on a number without
necessarily being aware of what type (class) of number is being
operated on.  MathArray knows implicitly what types of operations can
be performed on what types of numbers and will automatically cast 
itself to the correct number type representation to handle the
specific operation. Standard operations include addition, scalar and
matrix multiplication and logical operations. Mathematical operations
in the standard C math library are also supported, as well as
user-defined functions.
MathArray also does much more.  Arrays can be manipulated, transposed
and concatenated. One can extract subarrays or include subarrays within
larger arrays.
