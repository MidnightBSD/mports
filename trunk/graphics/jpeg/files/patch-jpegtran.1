+.SH EXIF FILES
+The EXIF variety of JPEG files, which are often produced by digital cameras,
+are recognized by jpegtran as EXIF files (i.e. not as JFIF, the
+usual variety of JPEG files). If the input file is recognized as EXIF (i.e.,
+there is an EXIF marker and no JFIF marker) the '-copy exif' option is
+automatically turned on if '-copy comments', or no '-copy' option, was
+specified. Thus, unless '-copy none' is specified an EXIF file is kept as EXIF
+and not converted to JFIF.
+.PP
+If a geometrical transformation is applied (e.g., rotate, transpose) the EXIF
+width and height fields are set to the width and height of the output
+image. Furthermore, the orientation field is reset to one, meaning tha the
+orientation of the output image is upright (i.e. normal).
+.PP
+Note that an explicitely given '-copy exif' option will output an EXIF file if
+the input is an EXIF file that was saved as JFIF, and that the EXIF marker is
+still present. This option is useful for recovering EXIF files that where
+converted to JFIF by a non EXIF-aware software. Note however, that the data in
+the EXIF marker is not validated, unless a geometrical transformation is
+applied.
