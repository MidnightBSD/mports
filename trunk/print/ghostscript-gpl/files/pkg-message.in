Note: in order to use the script dvipdf, dvips must be installed.
This program may be provided by either print/dvips or print/dvipsk-tetex
(print/dvipsk-tetex may be preferable since it doesn't conflict with
tetex things).

Also note that FAPIfontmap and FAPIcidfmap in
%%DATADIR%%/%%PORTVERSION%%/lib have to be configured first if
WITH_FT_BRIDGE is enabled.
