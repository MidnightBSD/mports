To enable printing with local printer you need to give group cups
r/w access to printer device:

1) Add following to /etc/devfs.rules (create if it doesn't exist):

[system=10]
add path 'unlpt*' mode 0660 group cups
add path 'ulpt*' mode 0660 group cups
add path 'lpt*' mode 0660 group cups

2) And following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_system_ruleset="system"

3) Restart devfs: /etc/rc.d/devfs restart

In case your system supports "devd" you can copy
$PREFIX/share/examples/lpt-cupsd.conf into $PREFIX/etc/devd/

To enable printing under Gimp and MS-Windows clients do the following:

1) Uncomment application/octet-stream line in mime.types
2) Uncomment application/octet-stream line in mime.convs
3) Restart cupsd
