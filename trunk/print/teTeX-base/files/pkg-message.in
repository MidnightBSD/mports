=== IMPORTANT NOTICE ===

- You may want to run texconfig(1) to configure teTeX for your
  local environment. You will find teTeX's local documentation
  in %%PREFIX%%/%%TEXMFDISTDIR%%/doc/.

- Note that if you have environment variables for teTeX in a wrong
  way (such as TEXINPUTS, TEXMF, TEXMFCNF, and so on),
  they may prevent teTeX from working.
