The Free Software Foundation's "sed" stream editor.

This utility exists in the MidnightBSD base collection, but the GNU
versions have added functionality that is sometimes useful.

Note that this port will install this utility with a `g' prefix,
for example gsed, but the texinfo documentation will refer to these
utilities without the `g' prefix.
