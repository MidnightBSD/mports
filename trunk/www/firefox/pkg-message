SMB issues:
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

SFTP:
Only sftp access using public key authentication works.  To easily
setup public key authentication to "remote_host":

ssh-keygen -t dsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH sever on remote_host must allow pub key authentication.

Please include the following information with any bug report:
* Output from 'uname -a'.
* Date/time stamp from www/firefox/Makefile.
* Where/when did the problem occur: configuring, building, or
	running firefox
* How can you reproduce the problem?
