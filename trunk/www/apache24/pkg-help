Hints:

- only a subset from the selected modules are enabled by default in
  httpd.conf.

- by default apache24 builds with static prefork MPM

- if MPM_SHARED is selected then all MPM modules will be build, but
  only the selected DEFAULT MPM module will be registered and enabled 
  in httpd.conf. For more information see:
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53882

Note:
  Shared MPM loading is at the moment not supported by most additional
  modules (php/perl/python) because they need to know the apache
  threading model during build time

  To build the develop/example modules specify additional the parameter
  -DIAMADEVELOPER (I am a developer)

For detailed module description visit
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/

and for the develop/example modules
