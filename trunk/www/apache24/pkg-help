Hints:

  - only a subset from the selected modules are activated by default in
    httpd.conf.

  - by default apache24 builds mpm_prefork, mpm_event and mpm_worker
    as dynamically loadable module.  Even mpm_event is the preferred
    MPM, mpm_prefork will be activated to keep compatibility with 
    pre-build php/perl/python/... modules (used by apache22/apache24).


Note:

  To build the develop/example modules specify additional the parameter
    -DIAMADEVELOPER (I am a developer)
