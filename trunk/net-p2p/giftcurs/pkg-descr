giFTcurs is a cursed frontend to the giFT daemon and has been described as
"seriously slick". It won't work that well without giFT, which you should have
already. The version in CVS always works with the daemon in CVS. The latest
giFTcurs release also works with the latest giFT release, and there are very
rarely any incompatible changes in the protocol.
