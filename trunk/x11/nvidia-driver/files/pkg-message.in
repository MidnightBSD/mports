To use these drivers, make sure that you have loaded the nvidia kernel
module, by doing

	# kldload nvidia

or adding

	nvidia_load="YES"

to your /boot/loader.conf (normally done automatically when installing
the port).

If you build this port with WITH_FREEBSD_AGP=yes, make sure you have
agp.ko kernel module compiled and installed, since nvidia.ko will
depend on it, or have your kernel compiled with "device agp".  Other-
wise the nvidia kernel module will not load.  Also, care to specify
correct ``Option "NvAGP"'' in ``Device'' section of your X11 configu-
ration file.

When building with Linux compatibility (WITH_LINUX=yes), make sure
linux.ko is available as well (or have it compiled in kernel).

Note that this driver does not support PAE-enabled kernels.

If X.org cannot start and reports

	(EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to obtain a shared memory identifier.

in /var/log/Xorg.0.log while actually you have ``options SYSVSHM''
enabled in kernel, the sysctl ``kern.ipc.shmall'' should be increased.

See %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README for more information.
