Due to severe instability, the Solid UPnP backend was disabled. Thus,
you will not get notifications about networked shares in the device
notifier. The UPnP functionality can be re-enabled by setting the
SOLID_UPNP environment variable:

$ cat > ~/.kde4/env/upnp.sh << EOF
SOLID_UPNP=1
export SOLID_UPNP
EOF
$ chmod +x ~/.kde4/env/upnp.sh
