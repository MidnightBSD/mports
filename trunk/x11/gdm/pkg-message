GDM is installed.

Do _NOT_ use /etc/ttys to start gdm at boot time.  This will result in gdm 
hanging or restarting constantly. Instead, add gdm_enable="YES" to 
/etc/rc.conf. GDM will be started automatic on the next reboot.

GDM uses its own locale.alias file to determine its language and especially
the GNOME 2 fontencoding. This file is located in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/gdm/locale.alias.  By default, the character set for every 
country using the EURO currency is set to ISO8859-15 in order to enable the 
EURO sign. If you do not feel comfortable with this, edit this file according 
to your preferences.
