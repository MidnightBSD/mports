Note for MidnightBSD 0.3:

Contrary to Linux, it is not necessary to use airmon-ng to enable the monitor
mode of your wireless card.  So do not care about what the manpages say about
airmon-ng, airodump-ng sets monitor mode automatically.

To return from monitor mode, issue the following command:

	ifconfig ${INTERFACE} -mediaopt monitor


Note for MidnightBSD 0.4+:

Due to the addition of virtual access points (VAP),  you need to
create a new wlan device in monitor mode to use with airodump-ng. To do so,
issue the following command:
	ifconfig ${VAP_INTERFACE} create wlandev ${INTERFACE} wlanmode monitor
