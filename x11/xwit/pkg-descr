xwit ("x window interface tool") is a hotch-potch collection of simple routines
to call some of those X11 functions that don't already have any utility commands
built around them. The reasoning behind this is that loosely every X function
should be accessible from a shell script.

For example, XWarpPointer() will move the X pointer, but no utility program
exists to do so on those rare occasions when you could really use it. xwit will
also resize, iconify, pop, and move windows given by name or id, change an icon,
title or name, set the screen saver going, and change individual key autorepeat
settings.
