# Licensed under the same terms as Subversion.

# A pre-commit hook to detect case-insensitive filename clashes.
#
# What this script does:
#  - Detects new paths that 'clash' with existing, or other new, paths.
#  - Ignores existings paths that already 'clash'
#  - Exits with an error code, and a diagnostic on stderr, if 'clashes'
#    are detected.
#
# How it does it:
#  - Get a list of changed paths.
#  - From that list extract the new paths that represent adds or replaces.
#  - For each new path:
#    - Split the path into a directory and a name.
#    - Get the names of all the entries in the version of the directory
#      within the txn.
#    - Compare the canonical new name with each canonical entry name.
#    - If the canonical names match and the pristine names do not match
#      then we have a 'clash'.
#
# Notes:
#  - All the paths from the Subversion filesystem bindings are encoded
#    in UTF-8 and the separator is '/' on all OS's.
#  - The canonical form determines what constitutes a 'clash', at present
#    a simple 'lower case' is used.  That's probably not identical to the
#    behaviour of Windows or OSX, but it might be good enough.
#  - Hooks get invoked with an empty environment so this script explicitly
#    sets a locale; make sure it is a sensible value.
#  - If used with Apache the 'clash' diagnostic must be ASCII irrespective
#    of the locale, see the 'Force' comment near the end of the script for
#    one way to achieve this.
#
# How to call it:
#
#   On a Unix system put this script in the hooks directory and add this to
#   the pre-commit script:
#
#     $REPOS/hooks/case-insensitive.py "$REPOS" "$TXN" || exit 1
