# List of path prefixes that we relax the ID keyword checks for.
# By "relax", it means that we won't fail a commit if isn't present.
# Everything else must still be in order though.
#
# These paths are used by verify.py and are in canonical form, after
# head/, tags/*/ etc is stripped off.
#
# These are python style regexps.
