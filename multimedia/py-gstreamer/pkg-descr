gst-python provides a convenient wrapper for the GStreamer library for
use in Python programs, and takes care of many of the boring details
such as managing memory and type casting.

Like the GTK library itself gst-python is licensed under the GNU LGPL, so is
suitable for use in both free software and proprietary applications.  It
is already in use in many applications ranging from small single purpose
scripts up to large full features applications.
