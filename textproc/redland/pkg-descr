Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for RDF allowing
the model to be stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements each
of the RDF model concepts in its own class so provides an object based API
for them. Some of the classes providing the parsers, storage mechanisms and
other elements are built as modules that can be added or removed as required.
