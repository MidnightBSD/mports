zssh (Zmodem SSH) is a program for interactively transferring files to a
remote machine while using the secure shell (ssh). It is intended to be a
convenient alternative to scp, allowing to transfer files without having to
open another session and re-authenticate oneself. zssh is an interactive
wrapper for ssh used to switch the ssh connection between the remote shell
and file transfers. Files are transferred through the zmodem protocol,
using the rz and sz commands.
