Dvi2tty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only devices
(terminals and lineprinters). The output is not very pretty many
times, but it still saves quite a lot of work, especially if you
have a little ways to walk to a laserprinter, for example.

This package is capable of showing dvi-files created with ASCII-jTeX.
