linux_dri installs binary linux DRI modules, libraries and basic programs to 
support and test 3d hardware acceleration of linux binaries with the DRI.

Compiled by anholt@FreeBSD.org on a debian unstable system, patched to
disable the new Damage protocol call for rotated rendering due to it being
unavailable in our linux base ports.
