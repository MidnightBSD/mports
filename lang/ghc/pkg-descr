Haskell is the standard lazy purely functional programming language.
The current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998,
with a revised version published in January 2003.

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising
compiler for the functional programming language Haskell 98 generating
good code for a variety of platforms.  GHC is a state-of-the-art
programming suite for Haskell and compiles Haskell to either native code
or C.  It implements numerous experimental language extensions to
Haskell, including concurrency, a foreign language interface, several
type-system extensions, exceptions, and so on.  GHC comes with a
generational garbage collector, a space and time profiler, comprehensive
set of libraries and an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.
