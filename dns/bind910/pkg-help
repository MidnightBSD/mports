When using the NATIVE_PKCS11 option, BIND will use the PKCS#11
engine specified by the named_pkcss11_engine variable in
/etc/rc.conf for *all* crypto operations.

This is primarily intended to be used in an authoritative
case.

If BIND will also be operating as a validating resolver,
NATIVE_PKCS11 should not be used, because the HSM will be
used for DNSSEC validations, and the HSM is likely to be
slower than the CPU for this purpose.  Additionally, the HSM
might not support all of the PKCS#11 API functions needed
for signature verification.

If using a chrooted instance of BIND, the OpenSSL engines
need to be accessible from within the chroot.  If BIND
is chrooted in /var/named, this can be achieved by either
copying content of /usr/local/lib/engines into
/var/named/usr/local/lib/engines, or by creating that
directory and adding this line to /etc/fstab:
/usr/local/lib/engines  /var/named/usr/local/lib/engines nullfs ro 0 0
