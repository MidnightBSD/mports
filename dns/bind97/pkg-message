	If you are running BIND 9 in a chroot environment, make		
	sure that there is a /dev/random device	in the chroot.		
									
	BIND 9 also requires configuration of rndc, including a		
	"secret" key.  The easiest, and most secure way to configure
	rndc is to run 'rndc-confgen -a' to generate the proper	conf	
	file, with a new random key, and appropriate file permissions.	
									
	The /etc/rc.d/named script in the base will do both for you.
