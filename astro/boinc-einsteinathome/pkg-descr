Einstein@Home - Search for gravitational waves

Use your unused CPU cycles to aid in computations analyzing telescope
information for possible gravitational waves emitted by pulsars as
predicted by Albert Einstein.

Einstein@home is based on BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing).  Several other projects besides Einstein@home are
using BOINC.  BOINC lets you participate in more than one project,
and it lets you specify what fraction of your computer time should go
to each project.
