Memcachedb is a distributed storage system designed for persistent. We
simplely hacked from memcached and tugela. But neither of them.
Memcachedb is not a cache solution, it is a persistent solution for
high-frequency writing and reading. It conforms to memcache protocol
(not completed, see below), so any memcached client can have
connectivity with memcachedb. Memcachedb uses Berkeley DB as a storing
backend, so lots of features including transaction and replication are
supported.
