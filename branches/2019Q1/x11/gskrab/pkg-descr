GS Krab is a framework and a daemon to enable GNUstep applications to
handle the special keys on multimedia keyboards. Since this would require
special hacks to work on different platform, and since those differents
platforms work differently, I thought putting those hacks together in a
centralized daemon would be the correct and clean way to do things.
