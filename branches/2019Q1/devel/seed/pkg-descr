Seed is a library and interpreter, dynamically bridging (through
GObjectIntrospection) the WebKit JavaScriptCore engine, with the GNOME
platform. Seed serves as something which enables you to write standalone
applications in JavaScript, or easily enable your application to be extensible
in JavaScript.
