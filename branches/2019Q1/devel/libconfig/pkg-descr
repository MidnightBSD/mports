Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured configuration
files. The file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And
unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code.

Libconfig is very compact -- just 25K for the stripped C shared library
(one-fifth the size of the expat XML parser library) and 39K for the
stripped C++ shared library. This makes it well-suited for
memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.

The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages. It works
on POSIX-compliant UNIX systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, FreeBSD)
and Windows (2000, XP and later).
