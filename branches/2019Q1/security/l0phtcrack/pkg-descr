L0phtCrack 1.5 is a tool for turning Microsoft LANMAN and NT password hashes
back into the original clear text passwords.  The program does this using
dictionary cracking and also brute force.  L0phtCrack returns not just the
LANMAN password but the NT password up to 14 characters in length.

L0phtCrack includes the ability to dictionary attack or brute force the
network NT server challenge that is used to prevent the OWF (one-way format)
from going across the wire in its plain-text format.  Sample network sniffed
challenges are in files sniff.txt and sniff2.txt.  This means you can obtain
NT passwords without administrator privileges when you have network access
between the client and the server.
