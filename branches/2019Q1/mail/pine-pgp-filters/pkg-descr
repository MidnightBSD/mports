Simple, fast, /bin/sh-based filters to use GnuPG with Alpine.

In addition to the standard functions of encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify
for inline messages, I added pseudo-filters to verify or decrypt messages
that were sent using MIME encoding.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to configure these filters.
