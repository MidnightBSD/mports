unclutter removes the cursor image from the screen so that it does not
obstruct the area you are looking at after it has not moved for a
given time. It does not do this if the cursor is in the root window or
a button is down. It tries to ignore jitter (small movements due to
noise) if you have a mouse that twitches.
