The GNOME Doc Utils is a collection of documentation utilities for the GNOME
project. Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and all
auxiliary files in the source tree, and it contains the DocBook XSLT
stylesheets that were once distributed with Yelp. Starting with GNOME 2.8, Yelp
require GNOME Doc Utils for the XSLT.
