Python interface to MySQL

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL database server for Python.
The design goals are:

- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0
- Thread-safety
- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)
- Compatibility with MySQL-3.22 and later

This module should be mostly compatible with an older interface
written by Joe Skinner and others. However, the older version is
a) not thread-friendly, b) written for MySQL 3.21, c) apparently
not actively maintained. No code from that version is used in
MySQLdb. MySQLdb is free software.
