	Known problems:
	1) DRD/Helgrind tool gives excessive false-positivies for the
	   internals of pthreads library.  This is now under
	   investigation.
	2) exp-ptrcheck tool doesn't work on BSD now

	If you'll encounter any problems when using Valgrind do not
	hesitate to contact the maintainer with the description of
	these problems.
