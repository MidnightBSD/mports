Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any
application as a lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic.
This means they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest
EC2 compute instance and everything in between - and they don't
require you to use a particular language, framework or packaging
system. That makes them great building blocks for deploying and
scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without depending
on a particular stack or provider.
