To enable postfix startup script please add postfix_enable="YES" in
your rc.conf

If you not need sendmail anymore, please add in your rc.conf:

sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"

And you can disable some sendmail specific daily maintenance routines in your
/etc/periodic.conf file:

daily_clean_hoststat_enable="NO"
daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"
daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
daily_submit_queuerun="NO"

If /etc/periodic.conf does not exist please create it and add those values.

If you are using SASL, you need to make sure that postfix has access to read
the sasldb file.  This is accomplished by adding postfix to group mail and
making the %%PREFIX%%/etc/sasldb* file(s) readable by group mail (this should
be the default for new installs).

If you are upgrading from Postfix 2.6 or earlier, review the RELEASE_NOTES to
familiarize yourself with new features and incompatabilities.
