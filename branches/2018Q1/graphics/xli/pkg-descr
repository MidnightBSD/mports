These utilities display several types of images under X11, or load images
onto the X11 root window.

A variety of options are available to modify images prior to viewing.  These
options include clipping, dithering, depth reduction, zoom (either X or Y
axis independently or both at once), brightening or darkening, input gamma
correction, and image merging.  When applicable, these options are applied
automatically (e.g. a color image to be displayed on a monochrome screen
will be dithered automatically).  An utility (xlito) is provided that allows
these viewing options to be appended to the image files.
