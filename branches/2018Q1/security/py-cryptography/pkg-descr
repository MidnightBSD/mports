cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic recipes and
primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your "cryptographic
standard library". It supports Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.2+, and PyPy.

cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level interfaces to
common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests
and key derivation functions.
