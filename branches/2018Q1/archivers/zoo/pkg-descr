Zoo is used to create and maintain collections of files in compressed
form.  It uses a Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm that gives space
savings in the range of 20% to 80% depending on the type of file
data.  Zoo can store and selectively extract multiple generations of
the same file.  Data can be recovered from damaged archives by
skipping the damaged portion and locating undamaged data with the help
of fiz(1).
