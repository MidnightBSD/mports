Folding@Home is a distributed computing project -- people from through out the
world download and run software to band together to make one of the largest
supercomputers in the world. Every computer makes the project closer to our
goals.
Folding@Home uses novel computational methods coupled to distributed computing,
to simulate problems thousands to millions of times more challenging than
previously achieved.
