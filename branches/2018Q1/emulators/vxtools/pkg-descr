This package allows you to read files from Veritas Journaled Filesystem.
Current version seems to support versions 2 and 4 (and 3, but this version
was never released, AFAIK). I don't plan a write version, because I don't
know journal log structure and I have *no* time to play with it. But I plan
a Linux kernel implementation.
