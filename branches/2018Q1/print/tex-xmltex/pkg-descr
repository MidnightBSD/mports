xmltex implements a non validating parser for documents matching
the W3C XML Namespaces Recommendation.  The system may just be used
to parse the file (expanding entity references and normalising
namespace declarations) in which case it records a trace of the
parse on the terminal.  Normally however the information from the
parse is used to trigger TeX typesetting code.  Declarations (in
TeX syntax) are provided as part of xmltex to associate TeX code
with the start and end of each XML element, attributes, processing
instructions, and with unicode character data.
