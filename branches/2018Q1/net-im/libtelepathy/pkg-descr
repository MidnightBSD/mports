The Telepathy project aims to provide a unified framework for all forms
of real time conversations, including instant messaging, IRC, voice
calls and video calls. It uses the DBus messaging system to provide a
simple interface for client applications, allowing them to quickly
benefit from Telepathy's functionality.
