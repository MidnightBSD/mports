Dmake is a make utility similar to GNU make or the Workshop dmake.

dmake is different from other versions of Make in that it supports
significant enhancements.

The original author(s) were WTICorp.com, but they appear to have lost
interest in maintaining the code.

This port installs the version maintained by the Apache OpenOffice.org
project.
