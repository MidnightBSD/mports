QtGStreamer is a set of libraries and plugins providing C++ bindings for
GStreamer with a Qt4-style API plus some helper classes for integrating
GStreamer better in Qt4 applications.

Currently, it consists of the following parts:
 * QtGLib        - Library providing C++/Qt bindings for parts of the GLib
                   and GObject APIs, a base on which QtGStreamer is built.
 * QtGStreamer   - Library providing C++/Qt bindings for GStreamer
 * QtGStreamerUi - Library providing integration with QtGui. Currently,
                   it only provides a video widget that embeds GStreamer's
                   video sinks.

In addition, it provides a "qwidgetvideosink" GStreamer element, an video
sink element that can draw directly on QWidgets using QPainter.
