Bible Retrieval System (BRS) consists of a textual database of the
Authorized ("King James") Version of the Old and New Testaments, a set
of libraries for finding and retrieving text, and a program ("bible")
which uses the libraries to retrieve Bible passages given references
on the command line or from standard input.
