This port of SCO / USL's 'cscope' lets one easily navigate large C programs.
It's designed to answer questions like where symbols are defined and used,
where variables are assigned, and much more.

The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) has made this available under a very friendly,
BSD-style Open Source License.
