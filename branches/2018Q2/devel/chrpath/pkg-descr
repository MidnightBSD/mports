chrpath allows you to modify the dynamic library load path (rpath) of
compiled programs. Only removing and modifying the rpath is supported.

Note: The modification performed is in-place; the new DT_RPATH cannot
be longer than the existing DT_RPATH value. Also, the binary can only
work with the ELF class of the host system.
