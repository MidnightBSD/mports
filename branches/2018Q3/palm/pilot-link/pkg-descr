pilot-link is a series of tools designed to extract and add data to a PalmPilot
organizer.  There are programs in here to transfer data, debug the pilot,
synchronize with calendars, and a set of include files and libraries with which
you may build your own applications in C, C++, Perl5, Tcl, Java, and Python.
