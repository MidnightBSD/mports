The hyperv-is provision a collection of kernel mode drivers as well as
user-space daemons to facilitate integration with Hyper-v to provide a
feature rich and high performance FreeBSD guest experience.

The FreeBSD Integration Service on Hyper-v includes a collection of kernel
mode drivers as well as user-space daemons to interact with the drivers
that are required to run Hyper-V-specific devices known as FreeBSD
Integration Services (BIS). It is to facilitate integration with Hyper-v
to provide a feature rich and high performance FreeBSD guest experience.
See the man page for a list of binaries and their functions.

FreeBSD support for hyperv-is was first added by Microsoft BSD Integration
Services Team <bsdic@microsoft.com>.
