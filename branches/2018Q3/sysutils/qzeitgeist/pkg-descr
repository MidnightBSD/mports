Zeitgeist is a service which logs the users's activities and events
(files opened, websites visites, conversations hold with other people,
etc.) and makes relevant information available to other applications.
It is able to establish relationships between items based on
similarity and usage patterns.

libQZeitgeist is a wrapper library around the Zeitgeist D-Bus API for
Qt, and is brought to you by Collabora in cooperation with the
Zeitgeist team and KDE.
