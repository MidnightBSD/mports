BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the underlying BIND
architecture.  Some of the important features of BIND 9 are:

DNS Security: DNSSEC (signed zones), TSIG (signed DNS requests)
IP version 6: Answers DNS queries on IPv6 sockets, IPv6 resource records (AAAA)
     Experimental IPv6 Resolver Library
DNS Protocol Enhancements: IXFR, DDNS, Notify, EDNS0
     Improved standards conformance
Views: One server process can provide multiple "views" of the DNS namespace,
     e.g. an "inside" view to certain clients, and an "outside" view to others.
Multiprocessor Support

BIND 9.9 includes a number of changes from BIND 9.8 and earlier releases,
including:
	NXDOMAIN redirection
	Improved startup and reconfiguration time, especially with large
		numbers of authoritative zones
	New "inline-signing" option, allows named to sign zones completely
		transparently, including static zones
	Many other new features, especially for DNSSEC

See the CHANGES file for more information on features.
