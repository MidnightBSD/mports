PyXML is a collection of libraries to process XML with Python.
It effectively extends and updates Python's built-in XML libraries
(the xml.* modules). It contains, among other things:

  xmlproc: a validating XML 1.0 parser written in Python
  Expat:   a nonvalidating XML 1.0 parser written in C, plus Python bindings
  PySAX:   SAX 1 and SAX2 libraries with drivers for most of the parsers
  4DOM:    a compliant DOM Level 2 implementation written in Python
  javadom: a Java-DOM-implementation-to-standard-Python-DOM adapter
  pulldom: a DOM implementation that supports lazy instantiation of nodes
  marshal: a module for serializing Python objects to XML formats including
             WDDX and XML-RPC
  sgmlop:  a C helper module that can speed up xmllib (deprecated) & sgmllib

It also provides the latest updates/fixes for minidom (the default
xml.dom.implementation), and includes an XPath 1.0 processor for minidom
(xml.xpath). Experimental XSLT 1.0 support for minidom can be added if the
port is installed with WITH_XSLT defined (e.g. "make install WITH_XSLT=yes").
