ptexenc is a useful library for Japanese pTeX (which stands for
publishing TeX, and is an extension of TeX by ASCII Co.) and its
surrounding tools.  ptexenc provides a better way of handling
character encodings.

ptexenc is not an official product of ASCII Co., so pTeX and other
tools need some patches to make use of it.  Some patches are included
within this archive.
