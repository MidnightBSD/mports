processing for mail, USENET news articles, digests, and several personal
organisers.  Printouts can be portrait, landscape or 2-up, and include
pretty headers with useful information (page number, printing date, file
name or supplied header).  Mp is very useful for making archive listings of
programs.

Includes mp.el an Emacs interface to mp.
