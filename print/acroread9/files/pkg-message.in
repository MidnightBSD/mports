=== WARNING ===

Before using Adobe Reader 9, linux_adobe.ko kernel module has to be loaded.
It is automatically loaded by %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/linux_adobe script on
boot time.  You can manually load it by

 # %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/linux_adobe start

without rebooting.

To run this version of Adobe Reader, set ADOBE_LANG=%%ADOBE_LANG%% and use
%%PREFIX%%/bin/acroread.  Note that when $LANG is set, $ADOBE_LANG will be set
automatically based on it.
