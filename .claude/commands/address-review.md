description: Fetch GitHub PR review comments and create todos to address them
---

Fetch review comments from a GitHub PR in this repository and create a todo list to address each comment.

# Instructions

1. **Determine the current repository:**
  ```bash
  REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
  ```

2. Extract the PR number and optional review ID from the user's message:
  - PR number only: "12345" or "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/12345"
  - Specific review: "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/12345#pullrequestreview-123456789"
  - Extract review ID from the hash fragment (e.g., "123456789")
  - If a full GitHub URL is provided, extract the org/repo from the URL instead of using the current repo

3. Fetch review comments:

  **If a specific review ID is provided:**
  ```bash
  gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/reviews/{REVIEW_ID}/comments | jq '[.[] | {path: .path, body: .body, line: .line, start_line: .start_line, user: .user.login}]'
  ```

  **If only PR number is provided:**
  ```bash
  gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/{PR_NUMBER}/comments | jq '[.[] | {path: .path, body: .body, line: .line, start_line: .start_line, user: .user.login}]'
  ```

4. Parse the JSON output and create a todo list with TodoWrite containing:
  - One todo per review comment
  - Format: "{file}:{line} - {comment_summary} (@{username})" (content)
  - Format: "Addressing {file}:{line}" (activeForm)
  - All todos should start with status: "pending"

5. Present the todos to the user - DO NOT automatically start addressing them
  - Show a summary of how many comments were found
  - List the todos clearly
  - Wait for the user to tell you which ones to address

# Example Usage

User: `/address-review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/12345#pullrequestreview-123456789`
User: `/address-review 12345`
User: `/address-review https://github.com/org/repo/pull/12345`

# Important Notes

- Automatically detect the repository using `gh repo view` for the current working directory
- If a GitHub URL is provided, extract the org/repo from the URL
- Include file path and line number in each todo for easy navigation
- Include the reviewer's username in the todo text
- If a comment doesn't have a specific line number, note it as "general comment"
- **NEVER automatically address all review comments** - always wait for user direction
- When given a specific review URL, no need to ask for more information
