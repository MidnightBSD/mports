In the directory %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/gitweb you can find all files to
make gitweb work as a public repository on the web.

All you have to do to make gitweb work is:
1) Copy the files %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/gitweb/git* to a directory on
   your web server (e.g. Apache2) in which you are able to execute
   CGI-scripts.
2) In gitweb.cgi, adjust the variable $projectroot to point to
   your git repository (that is where you have your *.git project
   directories).
