PicMonger is an automated NNTP (Usenet News) client.  In short, you point it
at your news server, select a group, and it scans the available (and not
previously scanned) posts for UUencoded or MIME base64-encoded binaries
(e.g. a JPEG image).  When a binary is found, it is automatically decoded
back to its original form.   If desired, PicMonger can also create thumbnail
preview pages, viewable in any web browser. 

Features:
* Intuitive GUI design 
* Automatic customizable HTML thumbnail preview page generation 
* Thumbnails maintain same aspect ratio as the original, within a size
  constraint specified by the user 
* Inter-session group memory (resumes scanning a newsgroup where you left off) 
* Inter-session options memory (remembers all of your customized settings) 
* GUI-based mangement of server and newsgroup lists 
* Fixes filenames to be ext2fs (Linux/Unix) friendly before they are written 
* Screens files and decodes only the file types you select 
* Easy installation (uses GNU autoconf/automake) 
* Error logging for easy troubleshooting (rarely an issue) 
* Distributed under the GNU GPL
