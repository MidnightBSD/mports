Trn is Threaded RN -- a newsreader that uses an article's references to
order the discussions in a very natural, reply-ordered sequence called
threads.  Having the replies associated with their parent articles not
only makes following the discussion easier, but also makes it easy to back-
track and (re-)read a specific discussion from the beginning.  Trn also
has a visual representation of the current thread in the upper right corner
of the header, which will give you a feel for how the discussion is going
and how the current article is related to the last one you read.

In addition, a thread selector makes it easy to browse through a large
group looking for interesting articles.  You can even browse through the
articles you've already read and select the one(s) you wish to read again.
Other nice features include the extract commands for the source and binary
groups, thread-oriented kill directives, a better newgroup finding strategy,
and lots more.  See the file NEW for a list of the things that are new to
trn 3.0 from previous versions.
