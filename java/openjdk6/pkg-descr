OpenJDK is an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition.

The version has all of Sun's bug fixes up to JDK 6 Release 11 and should be
the runtime equivelent to JDK6 Release 11.

Much of the OpenJDK code is licensed under the GPL version 2 with the
Classpath exception. The Java Hotspot virtual machine source code is
licensed under the GPL version 2 only.

OpenJDK 6 should supercede the java/jdk16 port at some point in time.
