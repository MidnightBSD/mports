You may install this Software only if you are currently a licensee
of FreeBSD (including substantially similar versions of FreeBSD) for
your own internal use only with your copy(ies) of FreeBSD (including
substantially similar versions of FreeBSD).  If you are an OEM - a person
who will bundle the Software with other software before distributing the
bundled product to end users - you must read and "accept" the provisions
of the OEM License Agreement.  You must read the License Agreement and
enter "YES" below to continue your install.  By doing so, you agree to
be bound by all of the terms of this License Agreement.

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This End User License Agreement ("Agreement")
is a legal agreement between you (in your capacity as an individual
and as an agent for your company, institution, or other entity) and the
FreeBSD Foundation ("Foundation").  Accessing, downloading, installing,
using or copying of the Software (as hereafter defined) by you or a third
party on your behalf indicates your agreement to be bound by the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.  If you do not agree to these terms and
conditions, do not access, download, install, use or copy the Software.
In the absence of this Agreement, you have no rights in the Software.
1.	LICENSE GRANT.

	(a)	Subject to all third party intellectual property claims
	and without warranty of any nature, Foundation hereby grants to
	you, and you hereby accept, a non-exclusive license for use in
	(x) general purpose servers and (y) general purpose desktop and
	laptop personal computers ("License") to:  (i) download, install
	and use the Software in binary executable form on one or more
	computers for use by a total number of end users not to exceed
	the number of your end users who are authorized to use FreeBSD;
	provided that you agree to implement reasonable controls to ensure
	that your use of the Software does not exceed such maximum number
	of end users; and (ii) download and/or use one or more copies of
	any related materials provided by Foundation ("Related Materials")
	in electronic format and/or one copies of the Related Materials
	in hard copy format subject to the following terms and conditions:

		(i)	other than as set forth in paragraph 1(a) above,
		you may not make or distribute copies of the Software,
		or electronically transfer the Software from one computer
		to another or over a network;

		(ii)	 you may not decompile, reverse engineer,
		disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a
		human-perceivable form;

		(iii)	you may not rent, lease or sublease the Software;

		(iv)	you may not modify the Software or create
		derivative works based upon the Software; and

		(v)	in the event that you breach any of the terms
		of this Agreement, Foundation may terminate the License
		and you must destroy all copies of the Software and
		Related Materials.

	(b)	you may make one copy of the Software in machine-readable
	form solely for back-up purposes; provided, however, that you
	must reproduce on such copy all copyright notices and proprietary
	legends on the original copy of the software.

	(c)	Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
	you may create a hyperlink between an Internet website owned and
	controlled by you and the Foundation's website, which hyperlink
	describes in a fair and accurate manner where the Software
	may be obtained, provided that you do not frame the Website or
	otherwise give the false impression that Foundation is somehow
	associated with, or otherwise endorses or sponsors your website.
	Any goodwill associated with such hyperlink shall inure to
	the sole and exclusive benefit of Foundation.  Other than the
	creation of such hyperlink, nothing in this Agreement shall be
	construed as conferring upon you any right to make any reference
	to Foundation or to its trademarks, service marks or any other
	indicia of origin owned by Foundation, or to indicate in any
	way that your products or services are in any way sponsored,
	approved, endorsed by or affiliated with Foundation.

2.	RIGHTS RESERVED.

	(a)	This License does not grant you any right to enhancements
	or updates to, or support or maintenance for, the Software or
	any modifications made by Foundation;

	(b)	Foundation is free to license the Software on terms
	different from those contained herein;

	(c)	Foundation and its licensors hereby expressly reserve
	all rights in the Software which are not expressly granted to
	you under the License; and, without limiting the generality of
	the foregoing, Foundation and its licensors retain all title,
	copyright, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights
	in the Software and any copies thereof, and you do not acquire
	any rights, express or implied, other than those expressly set
	forth in this Agreement.

3.	COPYRIGHT.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Software
is protected by United States copyright law and international treaty
provisions.  You must reproduce all copyright notices, trademark notices
and other proprietary notices of Foundation and its licensors on any
copies of the Software and Related Materials and you must not remove
such notices;

4.	MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT.  Foundation is under no obligation
whatsoever to provide maintenance or support for the Software or
to notify you of bug fixes, patches, or upgrades to the features,
functionality or performance of the Software ("Enhancements") (if any),
whether developed by Foundation or others.  If, in its sole discretion,
Foundation makes an Enhancement available to you and does not enter into a
separate written license agreement with you relating to such Enhancement,
then that Enhancement will be deemed incorporated into the Software and
subject to this Agreement.

5.	WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY TYPE OR NATURE, AND FOUNDATION AND ITS LICENSORS
HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY WARRANTIES
ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.
IN ADDITION, FOUNDATION AND ITS LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY
FOR THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR USEFULNESS OF THE SOFTWARE AND DO
NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL FUNCTION UNINTERRUPTED, THAT IT
IS ERROR-FREE OR THAT ANY ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.  YOU ASSUME TOTAL
RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO ANY DEFECTS OR INACCURACIES THEREIN.
6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL FOUNDATION OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER, WHETHER
SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FOUNDATION HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT
SHALL FOUNDATION'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $500 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY
YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.  BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE
ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN THE EVENT THAT APPLICABLE
LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
CLAIMS AND DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, FOUNDATION'S LIABILITY
IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

7.	INDEMNIFICATION.  You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Foundation and its licensors and their respective directors, officers,
agents, employees and volunteers from and against any and all claims,
suits, losses, damages, costs, fees and expenses arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement.  You shall pay all costs incurred by
Foundation in enforcing this provision, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and court costs.  You agree that under no circumstances will
Foundation indemnify you or any other person.

8.	TERM AND TERMINATION.  The License will continue perpetually
unless terminated by Foundation in accordance with this Agreement.  If you
breach any term of this Agreement and failure to cure such breach within
thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice specifying the breach,
this Agreement shall automatically terminate.  Upon the termination
of this Agreement, you shall immediately cease using the Software and
provide Foundation with written certification of your compliance with
the foregoing.	The termination of this Agreement shall not relieve you of
your obligations arising prior to such termination.  Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Sections 5 through 7 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

9.	EXPORT CONTROLS.  You shall observe all applicable United States
and foreign laws and regulations (if any) with respect to the export,
re-export, diversion or transfer of the Software, related technical data
and direct products thereof, including, but not limited to the Export
Administration Regulations.

10.	THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE.  You acknowledge and agree that the Software
includes Java2 Standard Edition (the "Technology") pursuant to Sun
Community Source License Copyright 1994-2003 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
All rights reserved.  You also agree to install and use the Software
on a product which (i) has a principle purpose that is substantially
different from that of the stand-alone Technology; (ii) represents a
significant functional and value enhancement to the Technology; (iii)
operates in conjunction with the Technology; and (iv) is not marketed
as a technology which replaces or substitutes for the Technology.

11.	GENERAL.  You shall not assert against Foundation or its licensors
any claim for infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual
property rights in any way relating to the Software.  This Agreement shall
be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of California, excluding its rules governing conflicts of laws.
In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed illegal
or unenforceable, Foundation may, but is not obligated to, post on the
Website a new version of this Agreement which, in Foundation's opinion,
reasonably preserves the intent of this Agreement.  This Agreement
is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of Foundation and
its successors and assigns.  This Agreement represents the entire
understanding of the parties, and superceded all previous communications,
written or oral, relating to the subject of this Agreement.
