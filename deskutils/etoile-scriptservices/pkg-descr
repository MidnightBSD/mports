ScriptServices is a gateway between GNUstep system services and Unix scripts.
It turns Unix scripts into GNUstep system services.
Scripts should be put under 
~/GNUstep/Library/ApplicaitonSupport/ScriptServices/
Whenever new scripts are installed, you need to update services by doing
`openapp ScriptServices --update`
A default script using `bc` comes with ScriptServices.
More scripts are in Examples directory.
